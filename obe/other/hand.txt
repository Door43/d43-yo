====== hand ======

===== Definition: =====

There are several figurative ways that "hand" is used in the Bible:

  * The term "hand" is often used in reference to God's power and action such as when God says, "Has not my hand made all these things?"
  * Expressions using "hand" also include giving someone over to the power or control of someone else, as in, “delivered them into the hands of the enemy.”
  * The term "laying on of hands" refers to placing a hand on a person in order to dedicate that person to God's service or to pray for healing.
  * Some other figurative uses of "hand" include:
      * "Do not lay a hand on" means "Do not harm."
      * To save "from the hand of" means to stop someone from harming someone else.
      * To be "close at hand" means to be "nearby."
      * The phrase "by the hand of" someone means "by" or "through" the action of that person. For example, "by the hand of the Lord" means that the Lord is the one who caused something to happen.

===== Translation Suggestions =====

  * These idioms and other figures of speech could be translated using figurative language that has the same meaning. Or the meaning could be translated using direct, literal language (see examples above).
  * When "hand" refers to the person, such as in "the hand of God did this," it could be translated as "God did this" or if God is speaking, "I did this."
  * The phrase "delivered them into the hands of" could be translated as, "caused them to be captured by" or "caused them to be conquered by."
  * To "die by the hand of" could be translated as, "be killed by."
