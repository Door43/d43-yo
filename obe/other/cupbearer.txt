====== cupbearer ======

===== Definition: =====

In ancient times, a "cupbearer" was a highly honored and trusted servant of a king or pharaoh, given the task of bringing the ruler his cup of wine, often tasting it first to make sure it had not been poisoned.

  * The literal meaning of this term is "someone who brings the cup."
  * Because of his trusted position, a cupbearer would often have influence in the decisions the ruler made.
  * Nehemiah was the cupbearer for King Artaxerxes of Persia during the time when some of the Israelites were in captivity in Babylon.
