===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the crucifixion and death of Jesus.

  * **divided up** - "distributed" or "shared."
  * **garments**  - The word "garments" means the pieces of clothing Jesus had been wearing. As the soldiers had earlier put Jesus' garments back on him, it is implied that they removed Jesus' clothing again when they crucified him. (See: Explicit/Implicit)
  * **charge against him** - This means a sign announcing the charge against Jesus, or the reason that the Roman government is crucifying him. (See: Metonym)
