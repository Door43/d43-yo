===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the crucifixion and death of Jesus.

  * **He saved others, but he cannot save himself** - This is an ironic statement, but it is not a true statement. The Jewish leaders are mocking Jesus and do not understand that he could have saved himself if he had wanted to. (See: Irony)   
  * **He is the King of Israel** - Again, the leaders are mocking Jesus. They do not believe he is the King of Israel.
