===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the crucifixion and death of Jesus.

  * **one of them**  - "One of them" probably means one of the soldiers.
  * **sponge** - A sponge is a kind of sea animal that becomes soft when it is wet. Sponges are able to take in and hold liquids which can then be squeezed or sucked out.
  * **reed staff** - This is probably just a reed.
  * **gave it to him**  - The word "him" refers to Jesus.
  * **gave up his spirit **- Jesus dies, but he does not just die. He decides when he will die. He had prophesied or told it ahead of time when he said, "No one takes my life from me, but I give it up myself."
