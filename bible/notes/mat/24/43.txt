\v 43 You know that if the owner of a house knew at what time in the night thieves would come, he would be awake and prevent the thieves from breaking in. Similarly, I will come as unexpectedly as a thief.
\v 44 So you need to be ready for my return, because I, the Son of Man, will return to the earth at a time when you do not expect me to come."

\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what hour the thief was coming, he would have been on guard and
would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 Therefore you must also be ready, for the Son of Man will come in an hour that you do not expect.
