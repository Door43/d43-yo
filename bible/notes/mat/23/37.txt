\v 37 "O people of Jerusalem, you who killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you who killed others whom God sent to you with stones. Many, many times I wanted to gather you together to protect you, like a hen gathers her young chicks under her wings. But you did not want me to do that.
\v 38 So listen to this: Your city will become an uninhabited place.
\v 39 Keep this in mind: You will see me again only when I return, when you say about me, 'God is truly pleased with this man who comes with God's authority.'"

\v 37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you! How often did I long to gather your children together, just as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, but you did not agree!
\v 38 See, your house is left to you abandoned.
\v 39 For I say to you, You will not see me from now on, until you say, 'Blessed
is he who comes in the name of the Lord.'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus laments over the people of Jerusalem who had rejected God.

  * **O Jerusalem, Jerusalem **- Jesus speaks as though the people of Jerusalem were there listening to him. Jesus said it twice to show how sad he was for them. (See: Metonymy and Apostrophe and Personification)
  * **you who kill the prophets and stone those who are sent to you!** - "You who killed the prophets who lived long ago, and you killed others whom God sent to you with stones." (UDB) (See: Doublet)
  * **to gather your children** - "to gather your people" or "to gather you"
  * **as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings** - Jesus uses a metaphor which describes how he wants to protect them the way a hen protects her young from harm by covering her chicks with her wings. (See: Metaphor)
  * **your house is left to you abandoned** - This is a metaphor. Possible meanings are 1) “God has abandoned you” or 2) “Your city appears empty.” It means that God has stopped protecting the people of Jerusalem, so enemies can attack them and drive them away. This is a prophecy about something that would happen soon. It can be translated as “you have an abandoned house.”(See: Metaphor)
  * **you will not see me until you say** - "You will not see me until the time comes when you will say"
