\v 25 "You hypocrites, you teachers of the law and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You make yourselves appear like good people to others. You are like cups and plates that women have washed on the outside, but on the inside they are very dirty with food and drink that you have stolen from others.
\v 26 You blind Pharisees! First you must stop stealing from others. Then you will be able to do what is righteous. Then you will be like a cup that is clean both outside and in."

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **Woe to you**  - See how you translated it in __23:13__.
  * **for you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate**  - This refers to how they look to others. (See: Metaphor)
  * **inside they are full of extortion and excess**  - "on the inside they are very dirty with greed and lack of self-control."
  * **You blind Pharisee**  - This refers to the Pharisees' not understanding the truth. They are not physically blind. (See: Metaphor)
  * **clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside may become clean also**  - Jesus is saying that if the inside of their lives is right with God then the outside of their lives will be good, too. (See: Metaphor)
