\v 27 "You hypocrites, you men who teach the laws and you Pharisees, how terribly God will punish you! You are like buildings over people's graves, building that are painted white so that people can see them and avoid touching them. The outside of those tombs are beautiful, but inside they are full of dead people's bones and filth.
\v 28 You are like those tombs. When people look at you, they think that you are righteous, but in your inner beings you are hypocrites, because you disobey God's commands."

\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside look 
beautiful, but on the inside are full of dead menâ€™s bones and of sorts of uncleanliness.
\v 28 In the same way, you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **Woe to you**  - see how you translated this in __23:13__  and other verses.
  * **like whitewashed tombs**  - The word "whitewashed" refers to a thin coat of cheap paint. Jesus uses a picture of painted graves that temporarily look good on the outside  to describe the scribes and Pharisees. (See: Simile)
  * **outwardly appear righteous to men**  - Jesus means that they do outward actions to make people think they are good.
