\v 29 "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! Your punishment will be terrible! You rebuild the tombs of the \add prophets whom others killed long ago\add*. You decorate the monuments \add that honor\add* righteous \add people\add*.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had \add lived\add* when our ancestors \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add lived\add*, we would not have helped \f + \ft metaphor \f* those who killed \f + \ft metonymy \f* the prophets.'
\v 31 Thus \add you recognize that you should honor the prophets, but you disregard the word of God that other men whom God has sent teach you. In that way\add* you testify against yourselves that you are descendants and disciples \f + \ft metaphor \f* of those who killed the prophets.

\v 29 "You men who teach the Jewish laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! How terribly God will punish you! You rebuild the tombs of the prophets whom others killed long ago. You decorate the monuments that honor righteous people.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had lived when our ancestors lived, we would not have helped those who killed the prophets.'
\v 31 In this way you admit that you are the descendants of those murderers; so, you are like them!

\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of
the righteous.
\v 30 You say, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have been participants with them in shedding the blood of the
prophets.'
\v 31 Therefore you testify to yourselves that you are sons of those who killed the prophets.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **Woe to you**  - See how you translated this in __23:13__.
  * **You say **- Jesus is using this phrase to let them know he is aware of their thoughts, beliefs, and things they had said.
  * **would not have been participants with them in shedding the blood **- "would not have helped our ancestors who killed"
  * **you testify to yourselves**  - "in this way you admit" (UDB)
  * **you sons of those who killed**  - "you are descendants of those who killed." These are not literal sons but they were their ancestors.
