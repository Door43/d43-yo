\v 13-14 \add Then Jesus said to the religious leaders\add*, "You men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees are hypocrites! There will be terrible punishment for \add you, because by teaching what is false\add*, you \add prevent people\add* [MTY\f + \ft Or: HYP \f*] \add who are thinking about letting\add* God rule their lives \add from doing that\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*. \add What you are doing is like\add* closing a gate \f + \ft metaphor \f* \add so that people who\add* are wanting to enter \add a city cannot go in\add*. As for \bd you,\bd* \add you do not let\add* God \add rule your lives. Neither do you allow\add* other people \add to let God rule their lives. What you do is like\add* not going into a \add house\add* yourselves, and not allowing others to enter it \add either\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*.\f + \fk very \fk* severely."\f*"

\v 15 "You are hypocrites, you men who teach the \add Jewish\add* laws and you Pharisees! Your punishment will be terrible, because you exert yourselves very much to get \add even\add* one person to believe what you teach. For instance, you travel across seas and lands \add to distant places\add* in order to do that. And \add as a result\add*, when one person \add believes what you teach\add*, you make that person much more deserving to go to hell than you yourselves \add deserve to\add*."

\v 13-14 Then Jesus said to the religious leaders, "You teachers of the law and you Pharisees, you are hypocrites! How terribly God will punish you, because you keep people from accepting him to rule over them. You are like men who close a gate so that others cannot enter God's city. You yourselves do not want to go in, and you keep others from entering, too." 



\p
\v 15 "You are hypocrites, you teachers of the law and you Pharisees! How terribly God will punish you! You work hard to get even one person to believe what you teach. You even travel across seas and lands to distant places in order to do that. And as a result, when one person believes what you teach, you make that person deserve to go to hell much more than you yourselves do."

\v 13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! You shut the kingdom of heaven against people. For you do not enter it
yourselves, and neither do you allow those about to enter to do so. 
\v 14 \f + Some authorities insert here, or after v. 12, v. 14 \fqa Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you
devour widowsâ€™ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.\f*
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you go over sea and land to make one convert. And when he has become one, you make him twice a son of hell as you yourselves are.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus begins to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **you shut the kingdom of heaven **- The Pharisees and scribes prevented the access to heaven, like a locked door.   (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **For you do not enter it ** - This was a way of saying the scribes and Pharisees didn't belong to God. 
  * **devour widows' houses**  - Verse 14 is not included in some of the early manuscripts, but if you chose to include it, this phrase refers to their taking advantage of the situations of these women to deprive them of their properties or from taking care of their needs.
  * **twice a son of hell**  - The phrase "son of hell" means "deserving of hell." So, "twice a son of hell" could be understood as "two times deserving of hell" or "make them worse than yourselves." (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
