\v 34 Take note that this is why I will send prophets, wise men, and other men who will teach you \add my message\add*. You will kill some of them by nailing them to crosses, and you will kill some in other ways. You will whip some of them in the places where you worship and \add you will\add* chase them from city to city.
\v 35 As a result, God will consider that you are guilty for killing \f + \ft synecdoche \f* all the righteous \add people\add*, including killing \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add Adam's son\add* Abel, who was a righteous man \f + \ft synecdoche \f*, and Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom you \add are guilty of\add* killing \add in the holy place\add* between the Temple and the altar, and for killing \add all the prophets\add* who lived between \add the times that those two men lived\add*.
\v 36 Think about this: You people who have observed my ministry, it is you whom \add God\add* will punish \add for killing all\add* those \add prophets\add*!"

\v 34 Take note that this is why I will send prophets, wise men, and teachers. You will kill some of them by nailing them to crosses, and you will kill some in other ways. You will whip some of them in the places where you worship and you will chase them from city to city.
\v 35 So God will consider that you and your ancestors are guilty for killing all the righteous people who ever lived on earth, including Adam's son Abel, who was a righteous man, and Zechariah, the son of Barachiah, whom your ancestors killed in the holy place between the temple and the altar. You also killed all the prophets who lived between the times that those two men lived.
\v 36 Think about this: You people who have observed my ministry, it is you whom God will punish for killing all those prophets!"

\v 34 Therefore, see, I send to you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify; and some
of them you will whip in your synagogues and chase from city to city.
\v 35 The result is that upon you will come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of
Zachariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the sanctuary and the altar.
\v 36 Truly I say to you, All these things will happen to this generation.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **I send to you **- Jesus is speaking to the scribes and Pharisees about the people he will send to them.
  * **upon you will come **- This can be translated as "God will consider that you and your ancestors are guilty for killing." (UDB)
  * **all the righteous blood shed on the earth **- "all the righteous people that others have killed who ever lived on earth" (UDB)
  * **Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah**  - The people to whom Jesus was talking would have known these Old Testament names. They are used here to include the first murder to the last person wrongfully killed. (See: Synecdoche)
  * **Zechariah **- This was probably the priest referred to in 2 Chronicles 24:20-22. This was not the father of John the Baptist.
