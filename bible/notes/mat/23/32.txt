===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to speak against the religious leaders because of their hypocrisy.

  * **you fill up the measure ** - This phrase is used to give the idea of a cup (a portion), partly filled by fathers, completely filled by the sons. This could be translated "you finished committing" (UDB) your father's sins.
  * **You serpents, you offspring of vipers**  - This compares the scribes and Pharisees to children of dangerous and poisonous snakes. This is repeated to stress how bad they are. (See: Metaphor and Doublet)
