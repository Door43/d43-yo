===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus being questioned by the high priest.

  * **Then they**  - It is unclear who the pronoun "they" refers to. If necessary, this can be translated "Then some of the men."
  * **spat in his face**  - This would have been intended as an insult.
  * **beat him**  - "struck him" or "struck him with their fists" (UDB)
  * **Who is it that struck you **- This can be written as a statement as in the UDB.
