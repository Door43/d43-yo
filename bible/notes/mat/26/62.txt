\v 62 The high priest stood up and said to him, "Do you have no answer? What is it that they are testifying against you?"
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. The high priest said to him, "I command you by the living God, tell us whether
you are the Christ, the Son of God."
\v 64 Jesus replied to him, "You have said it yourself; but I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the
right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of Jesus being questioned by the high priest.

  * **they are testifying against you **- "these witnesses are testifying against you"
  * **testifying against you **- "saying to accuse you" (UDB) or "witnessing against you"
  * **I command you by the living God**  - Caiaphas is commanding Jesus, as being under oath in court, to answer his question. (see UDB)
  * **tell us whether you are the Christ **- "tell us if you are the Christ"
  * **You have said it yourself**  - This is an expression that indirectly implies in this case a “Yes” answer to the high priest. (see UDB)
  * **but I tell you, from now on you **  - Both pronouns "you" here are plural, so Jesus is saying this not only to the high priest but also to the other persons who are present.
  * **from now on **- "in the future" or maybe "some day." It probably does not mean "from this moment on" (a literal translation) because they did not see Jesus in the way he described.
  * **at the right hand of Power**  - "at the right hand of Almighty God"
  * **coming on the clouds of heaven**  - A direction of his coming is not given here, so the translation should avoid either "coming up" or "coming down."
