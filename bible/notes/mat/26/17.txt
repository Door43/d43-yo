\v 17 On the first day of the week long Festival of Bread with No Yeast, the disciples went to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the meal for the Passover celebration so that we can eat it with you?"
\v 18 Jesus instructed two of the disciples about what they should do. He said to them, "Go into the city to a man with whom I have previously arranged this. Tell him that I, the Teacher, say this: 'The time that I told you about is near. I am going to celebrate the Passover meal with my disciples at your house, and I have sent these two to prepare the meal.'"
\v 19 So the two disciples did as Jesus told them. They went and prepared the Passover meal in that man's house.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus prepares to eat the Passover meal with his disciples.

  * **unleavened Bread **- This refers to a Jewish festival that was celebrated for more than one day. (see UDB)
  * **eat the Passover meal **- The meal of celebration of the Passover began in Exodus 12 when the Jewish people were "passed over" by an angel of death if they had put blood from the lamb (that they ate in the Passover meal) on the door posts of their houses.
  * **He said, "Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is at hand; I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples."'"** - Jesus is saying to his disciples to tell a certain man what Jesus ("The Teacher") says to tell that man. All or part of this could be expressed indirectly. “He told his disciples to go into the city to a certain man and say to him that the Teacher says 'My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.'” If you don't have direct quotations in your language, you could do it this way: “He told his disciples to go into the city to a certain man and say to him that the Teacher says his time is at hand. He will keep the Passover at your house with his disciples.”
  * **My time** - This has the meaning of "The time God has set for me" or "My appointed time" or "The time that I told you about." (UDB).
  * **is at hand **- This can mean "is near" (UDB) or "has come." (See: Idiom)
  * **keep the Passover**  - "keep the Passover meal" or "celebrate the Passover with a special meal"
