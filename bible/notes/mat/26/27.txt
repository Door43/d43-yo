===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to teach his disciples as he eats the Passover meal with them.

  * **took a cup** - This would have been a cup with contents they were to drink. (See: Metonymy)
  * **gave it to them** - The word "them" refers to the disciples.
  * **this is my blood** - "this represents my blood." This is probably a metaphor, not literally his blood. (See: Metaphor)
  * **blood of the covenant** - This refers to a new covenant being put into effect when Jesus' blood was going to be shed on the cross.
  * **is poured out** - “is poured out in death” or “will soon flow out of my body"  or "will flow out of my wounds when I die”
  * **fruit of the vine** - "wine" (or "fermented fruit juice" or "fruit juice" if wine is not known). The fruit of the vine refers to grapes, a fruit made into a drink.
