\v 41 You must keep alert and pray so that you can resist when anyone tempts you to sin. You want to do what I tell you, but you are not strong enough to actually do it."

\v 39 He went a little further, fell on his face, and prayed; he said, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will."
\v 40 He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, "What, could you not watch with me for one hour?
\v 41 Watch and pray that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."

===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins the account of Jesus praying in the garden of Gethsemane.

  * **fell on his face **- This is an intentional action and not accidental. "he threw himself face down on the ground" (UDB)
  * **My Father** - Jesus is talking to God the Father.
  * **cup** - "time" or "cup of suffering." (UDB) The cup represents the sufferings that Jesus had to go through.
  * **What, could you not watch with me for one hour** - Jesus doesn't expect them to answer this question. He is expressing his disappointment. (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **The spirit indeed is willing** - "Your intentions are good"
  * **the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak** - The word "flesh" refers to their "body." Even though they wanted to stay awake, their bodies were so tired. (See: Metaphor)
