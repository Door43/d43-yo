\v 52 Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its sheath! All those who try to kill others with a swordâ€”someone else will kill them with a sword!
\v 53 Do you think that if I asked my Father, he would not immediately send more than twelve armies of angels to help me?
\v 54 But if I did that, what the prophets have written in the Scriptures about what will happen to the Messiah would not be fulfilled."

\v 51 Behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the servant of the 
high priest, and cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place, for all those who take up the sword will perish by the
sword.
\v 53 Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels?
\v 54 But how then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that this must happen?"

===== Translation Notes: =====

This continues the account of the arrest of Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane.

  * **Behold** - standard note
  * **Do you think that I could not call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels **- This is a rhetorical question that could be translated if necessary as "I could call upon my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels." (See: Rhetorical Question)
  * **my Father **- Jesus is referring here to God the Father.
  * **more than twelve legions of angels **- The specific number of angels is not important; the idea is that the Father could easily defend Jesus if Jesus asked him.
  * **legions**  - A legion was a part of the Roman army that, at the time, was made up of about six thousand soldiers. "Legions" could be translated "regiments" or "armies." (UDB)
  * **the scriptures**  - Jesus is not pointing out specific Scripture prophecies here, but is pointing out that the events happening to Jesus at that time were fulfillment of Scriptures.
