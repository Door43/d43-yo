===== Translation Notes: =====

One of the disciples agrees to help the Jewish leaders arrest and kill Jesus.

  * **to deliver him to you** - The word "him" refers to Jesus.
  * **deliver him to you** - "turn him over to you" or "help you arrest him" 
  * **thirty pieces of silver** - Since this amount relates to a specific Old Testament prophecy by the prophet Zechariah, it is better to retain the form of "thirty pieces of silver" rather than to convert this to a modern currency.
  * **to deliver him to them** - "to help the chief priests arrest Jesus"
