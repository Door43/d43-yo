This begins the account of how Peter denies he knows Jesus.

  * **courtyard **- This would have been in an open area in the residence of the high priest, which was probably large and expensive.
  * **he denied **- This means Peter refused to admit that he was with Jesus.
  * **denied **- If an object of Peter's denial is needed, this can be translated "denied it" (UDB) or "denied what she said."
  * **I do not know what you are talking about**  - This does not mean that Peter was unable to understand what the servant girl was saying. This statement was Peter's denial that he had been with Jesus.
