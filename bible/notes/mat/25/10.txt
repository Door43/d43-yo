  * **and the door was shut**  - "and someone shut the door." (See: Active/Passive)
  * **Master, master **- This does not necessarily refer to Lord as deity; alternate translations are "Lord, lord" or "Sir." (UDB)
  * **open for us**  -  "open the door for us." (See: Explicit and Implicit Information)
  * **But he answered and said ** - "But the bridegroom answered and said"
  * **I do not know you** - The plural pronoun "you" refers to the five foolish virgins.
  * **for you do not know the day or the hour** - "for you do not know either the day or the hour when the Son of Man will come."  The plural pronoun "you" refers to the disciples to whom Jesus is talking privately on the Mount of Olives.
