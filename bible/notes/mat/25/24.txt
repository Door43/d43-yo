\v 24 Then the servant who had received one thousand dollars came. He said, 'Boss, I \add was afraid of you\add*. I knew that you are a man who does not do foolish things with his money. \add You even\add* take\add from others money\add* that does not really belong to you\add , like a farmer who\add* harvests \add grain from another man's field\add* where he did not even plant \add the seeds\add*.
\v 25 So because I was afraid \add of what you would do to me if I did not make a profit from my business\add*, I went out and hid your thousand dollars in the ground \add to keep it safe\add*. Here, this is \add the money\add* that belongs to you!'

\v 24 Then the servant who had received one bag of gold came. He said, 'Master, I was afraid of you. I knew that you are a man who expects to make a lot of money even if you invest nothing, like a farmer who tries to harvest a field he did not plant.
\v 25 I was afraid of what you might do if I lost the money you lent me to invest, so I hid it in the ground. Here it is now; please take it back!'

===== Translation Notes: =====

Jesus continues to tell a parable about faithful and unfaithful servants.

  * **strict man**  - "harsh man" or "tough man"
  * **you reap where you did not sow** - "you gather garden food from gardens in which someone else sowed the seed"
  * **and you harvest where you did not scatter** - "and you collect garden food from fields where someone else scattered the seed"
  * **you reap where you did not sow, and you harvest where you did not scatter**  - These two phrases are saying the same thing in different ways. (See: Parallelism)
  * **scatter **- In those days they often scattered the seed instead of planting in rows.
  * **See, you have here what belongs to you**  - "See, here is what is yours" or "Here it is now; please take it back" (UDB)
