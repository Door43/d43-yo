\v 19 Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, "Why did you go you with us, too? Return and stay with King Absalom, for you are a foreigner and an exile. Return to your own place.
\v 20 Since you just left yesterday, why should I make you wander all over with us? I do not even know where I am going. So return and take your fellow countrymen back. May loyalty and faithfulness go with you."
