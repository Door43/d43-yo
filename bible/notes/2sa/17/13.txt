\v 13 If he retreats into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city and we will drag it into the river, until there is no longer even a small stone found there."
\v 14 Then Absalom and the men of Israel said, "The Hushai the Archite's advice is better than Ahithophel's." Yahweh had ordained the rejection of Ahithophel's good advice order to bring destruction on Absalom.
