====== 2 Samuel 14:7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Now, all my family oppose me. They are insisting that I allow them to kill my son who is still alive \f + \ft metonymy \f*, in order that they may get revenge for his killing his brother. But if they do that, I will not have any son to inherit \add my possessions\add*. That would be like \f + \ft metaphor \f* extinguishing the last coals of a fire, and my husband would not have a son to preserve our family's name. \f + \ft doublet \f*"

\v 7 Now, all my family oppose me. They are insisting that I allow them to kill my son who is still alive, in order that they may get revenge for his killing his brother. But if they do that, I will not have any son to inherit my possessions. I will be without any son at all, and my husband will have no son to preserve our family's name."

<usfm>
\v 7 And now the whole clan has risen against your servant, and they say, 'Hand over the man who struck his brother, that we may put him to death, to pay for the life of his brother whom he killed. And so they would destroy the heir also.' Thus they will put out my ' burning coal ' that I have left, and that would leave to my husband neither name nor a descendant on the face of the earth."
