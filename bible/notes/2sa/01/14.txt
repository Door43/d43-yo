\v 14 David asked him, "Why were you not afraid that you would be punished if you killed Saul, whom Yahweh made king?
\v 15-16 You yourself said, 'I killed the man whom Yahweh appointed to be the king.' So you have made yourself guilty; you deserve to die!" Then David summoned one of his soldiers and said to him, "Kill him!" So the soldier killed him.
