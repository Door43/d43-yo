\v 9 Absalom happened to meet some of David's soldiers. Absalom was riding his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a large oak tree, and his head was caught up in the tree branches. He was left dangling between the ground and the sky while the mule he was riding kept going.
\v 10 Someone saw this and told Joab, "Look, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!"
\v 11 Joab said to the man who told him about Absalom, "What! You saw that but did you did not strike him down to the ground? I would have given you ten  silver shekels and a soldier's belt."
