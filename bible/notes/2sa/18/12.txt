\v 12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if you gave me a thousand pieces of silver, I would not have done anything to harm [IDI] the king's son. We all heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake, do not harm my son Absalom!'
\v 13 If I had disobeyed the king and killed Absalom, the king would have heard about it, because the king hears about everything, and even you would not have defended me!"

\v 12 The man replied to Joab, "Even if I received a thousand silver shekels, still I would not have reached out my hand against the kingâ€™s son, because we all heard the king
command you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, 'No one must touch the young man Absalom.'
\v 13 Otherwise if I had secretly taken Absalom's life, since there is nothing hidden from the king, you yourself would
have been against me."
