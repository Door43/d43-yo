====== Ecclesiastes 05:15-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 15 When we are born,
\q2 we do not bring anything with us,
\q1 and when we die,
\q2 we take nothing with us
\q1 from all that we have earned by our working hard.
\p
\v 16 That also seems senseless.
\q1 People bring nothing \add into the world when they are born\add*,
\q2 and they leave \add this world\add* taking nothing with them.
\q1 They have worked hard,
\q2 but they receive no lasting benefit \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\q1
\v 17 Furthermore, \add rich people\add* are always miserable \f + \ft metaphor \f* and sad,
\q2 and depressed\f + \ft Or: discouraged \f* and often sick and resentful\f + \ft Or: thinking that what has happened to them is unfair \f*.

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 15 As a man is born naked from his motherâ€™s womb, 
\q2 so also he will leave this life naked. 
\q1 He can take in his hand nothing from his work.
\v 16 another severe evil is 
\q1 that exactly as a person came, so also he must go away. 
\q1 So what profit has does anyone get in working for the wind?
\q1 
\v 17 During his days he eats with darkness 
\q2 and is greatly distressed with sickness and anger.
