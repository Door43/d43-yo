\v 9 Two people work better than one;
\q2 together they can earn a good pay for their labor.
\q1 
\v 10 For if one falls, the other can lift up his friend. 
\q2 However, sorrow follows the one who is alone when he falls, 
\q2 if there is no one to lift him up.

\v 11 And if two lie down together, they can be warm, 
\q2 but how can one be warm alone?
