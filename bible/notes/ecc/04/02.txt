\v 2 So I thought that those who are already dead are more fortunate
\q2 than those who are still alive.
\q1
\v 3 And those who have not been born yet
\q2 are more fortunate than those who are still alive and those who have died,
\q1 because those who have not been born have not seen all the evil things that are done on the earth.

\v 2 So I thought that those who are already dead are more fortunate
\q2 than those who are still alive.
\q1
\v 3 And those who have not yet been born

\q1 
\v 2 So I congratulate the dead, those who have already died, 
\q2 not the living, those who are still alive.

\v 3 However, more fortunate than both of them is the one who has not yet lived, 
\q2 the one who has not seen any of the evil acts that are done under the sun.
