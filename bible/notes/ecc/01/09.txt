\v 9 Whatever has been is what will be, 
\q2 and whatever has been done is what will be done.  
\q1 There is nothing new under the sun.
\q1
\v 10 Is there anything about which it may be said, 
\q2 'Look, this is new'?
\q1 Whatever exists has already existed for a long time,
\q2 during ages which came long before us.
\q1
\v 11 No one seems to remember the things that happened in ancient times.
\q2 And the things that happened much later 
\q2 and that will happen in the future
\q1 will not likely be remembered either."
