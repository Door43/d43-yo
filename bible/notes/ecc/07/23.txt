\v 24 Wisdom seems to be far from me;
\q2 there is no one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* who can truly understand everything.
\q1
\v 25 But I decided to investigate things and
\q2 by my wisdom try to understand the reason for everything.

\v 23 All this have I proven by wisdom. I said, 
\q1 "I will be wise," 
\q2 but it was more than I could be.
\q1 
\v 24 Wisdom is far off and very deep. 
\q2 Who can find it?
\q1 
\v 25 I turned my heart to learn and examine 
\q2 and seek wisdom and the explanations of reality, 
\q1 and to understand that evil is stupid 
\q2 and that folly is madness.
