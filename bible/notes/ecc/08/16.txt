====== Ecclesiastes 08:16-17 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I thought about being wise and about people who work very hard on this earth, working day and night and not taking time to sleep.
\v 17 Then I thought about everything \f + \ft hyperbole \f* that God has done, and I realized that no one can understand everything that happens here on this earth. Truly, people are not able to fully understand everything \add that God does\add*, even if they try hard to do that. Even if wise people claim that they understand it all, they cannot.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 When I applied my heart to know wisdom and to understand the work that is done on the earth, work often done without sleep for the eyes at night or in the day, 
\v 17 then I considered all of God's deeds, and that man cannot understand the work that is done under the sun. No matter how much a man labors to find the answers, he will not find them. Even though a wise man might believe he knows, he really does not.
