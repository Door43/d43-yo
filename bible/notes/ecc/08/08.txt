\q2 and we cannot control when we will stop breathing and die.
\q1 Soldiers are not permitted to go home during a battle,
\q2 and evil people will not be saved by doing what is evil.

<usfm>
\q1 
\v 8 No one has power over the breath of life to stop breathing, 
\q2 and no one has power over the day of his death. 
\q1 No one is discharged from the army during a battle, 
\q2 and wickedness will not rescue those who are its slaves.
\v 9 I have realized all this; I have applied my heart to every kind of work that is done under the sun.
There is a time when a person has power to do evil to others.
