===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **sold…brought the money…distribution was made**  - Various believers did this over time, not all at once.
  * **laid it at the apostles’ feet** - It was the believers way to express: 1) publicly demonstrate a changed heart, and 2) giving the apostles the authority over the distribution of the gift.
  * **as anyone had need** - It seems the needs of believers were observed over a period of time; items were not simply handed out whenever someone said they needed something.
