\v 6 When Paul saw that the one part of the council were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he spoke loudly in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is because of the confidence in
the resurrection of the dead that I am being judged."
\v 7 When he said this, an argument began  between the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, no angels, and no spirits, but the Pharisees say that all of these exist.
