===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **fastening his eyes upon him**  - "staring at him" or "looking intently at him"
  * **the lame man looked at them**  - "the lame man paid close attention to them"
  * **silver and gold**  - This is placed at the beginning of the sentence to show that this is what the man expects to receive but Peter does not have any, and to contrast it with what Peter does have and want to give him. The phrase "silver and gold" is a mentonym for money. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
