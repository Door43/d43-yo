\v 23 For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom also I worshipâ€”his angel stood beside me 
\v 24 and said, "Do not be afraid, Paul. You must stand before Caesar, and see, God in his kindness has given to you all those who are sailing with you.
\v 25 Therefore, men, take courage, for I trust God, that it will happen just as it was told me.
\v 26 But we must wreck upon some island."
