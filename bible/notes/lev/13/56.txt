\v 56 If the priest examines the article, and if the mildew has faded after it was washed, then he must tear out the contaminated part from the garment or from the leather, or from the woven or knitted material.
\v 57 If the mildew still appears in the garment, either in the woven or knitted material, or in anything made of leather, it is spreading. You must burn whatever has the mildew. 
\v 58 The garment or anything woven or knitted from wool or linen material, or leather or anything made with leatherâ€”if you wash it and the mildew is gone, then the object must be washed a second time, and it will be clean.
