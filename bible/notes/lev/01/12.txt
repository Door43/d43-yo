\v 12 Then he must cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest will lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire, which is on the altar,
\v 13 but the inner parts and the legs he must wash with water. Then the priest will offer the whole, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, and it will produce a sweet aroma for Yahweh; it will be an offering made to him by fire.
