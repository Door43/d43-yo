\v 5 When you bring an offering to maintain fellowship with me, offer it in a way that will cause me to accept it.
\v 6 The meat should be eaten on the day that you sacrifice it, but you are permitted to eat some of it on the next day. Anything that remains until the third\f + \ft Or: next \f* day must be completely burned.
\v 7 For any of it to be eaten on the third day is very displeasing to me, and I will not accept that offering.
\v 8 I will punish anyone who eats it \add after the second day\add*, because he will have not respected what I say is holy. And that person must no longer be allowed to associate with my people.

\v 5 When you offer a sacrifice of fellowship offerings to Yahweh, you must offer it that you may be accepted.
\v 6 It must be eaten the same day you offer it, or on the next day. If  anything remains until the third day, it must be burned.
\v 7 If it is eaten at all on the third day, it is defiled. It must not be accepted, 
\v 8 but everyone who eats it must arry his own guilt because he has desecrated what is holy to Yahweh. That person must be cut off from his people.
