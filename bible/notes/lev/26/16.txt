\v 16 In that case, these are the things that I will do to you. I will suddenly send disasters that will ruin you. You will have diseases that cannot be cured, and fevers that will cause you to become blind and will slowly kill you. It will be useless for you to plant your fields, because your enemies will eat the crops that grow.
\v 17 I will reject you, so your enemies will conquer you. Then they will rule over you, and you will be so terrified that you will run away even if they do not pursue you.

<usfm>
\v 16 If you do these things, then I will do this to you: I will inflict terror on you, diseases and fever that will destroy your eyes and make your life slowly die off. You will plant your seeds for nothing, because your enemies will eat their produce.
\v 17 I will set my face against you, and you will be overpowered by your enemies. Men who hate you will rule over you, and you will run away, even when no one is chasing you.
