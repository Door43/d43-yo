<usfm>
\v 14 Yahweh also said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*,
\v 15 "When you sin, without intending to, by not giving to Yahweh the things that you are required to give to him, you must pay a penalty by bringing to Yahweh a ram that has no defects. You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official standard in the temple. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.
\v 16 But you must also make restitution for what you failed to give to Yahweh, adding one-fifth of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a sacrifice for the sin that you have committed and cause you to no longer be guilty; and you will be forgiven.

\v 14 Yahweh also said to Moses to tell the people:
\v 15 "When you sin, without intending to, by not giving to me, Yahweh, the things that you are required to give to him, you must pay a penalty by bringing to me a ram that has no defects. You must determine how much silver it is worth, by using the official standard in the sacred tent. It will be an offering to cause you to no longer be guilty.
\v 16 But you must also make restitution for failing to pay him what has been set apart as only for him. Also, you must add one fifth of its value. You must give that to the priest. He will offer the ram as a sacrifice for the sin that you have committed and cause you to no longer be guilty, and I will forgive you.

\v 14 Then Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 15 "If any one violates a command and sins by failing to pay anything that is required by Yahweh, but if he is at first not aware that he has sinned, then he must bring his guilt offering to Yahweh. This offering must be a ram without blemish from the flock; its value must be appraised in silver shekels—the tabernacle shekel—as a guilt offering.
\v 16 He must satisfy Yahweh for what he had done wrong in connection with what is holy, and he must add one fifth to it and give it to the priest. Then the priest will make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and that person will be forgiven.
