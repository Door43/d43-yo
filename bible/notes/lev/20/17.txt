\v 17 If a man has sexual relations with his sister, either his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter—if he has sexual relations with her and she with him, it is a shameful thing. They must be cut off from the presence of their people, because he has had sexual relations with his sister. He must carry his guilt.
