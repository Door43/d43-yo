\v 12 Then he must take some burning coals from the bronze altar and put them into the incense burner. Then he must fill his hands with fragrant, finely ground incense. Then he must take the incense and the incense burner inside the curtain into the very holy place, in the sacred tent.
\v 13 There he must put the incense on the burning coals, and a cloud of burning incense will rise up over the lid of the sacred chest. If he obeys these instructions, he will not die as Korah did, who had offered incense incorrectly.
