<usfm> \v 4 I, John, am writing this letter to the seven groups of believers in the province of Asia. May God be kind to you and give you peace, for he is the one who has always existed, who exists now, and who will always exist in the future. May the seven spirits who are sitting in front of his throne do these things for you, too. \v 5 May Jesus Christ also—who has faithfully told us the truth about God and—be kind to you and give you peace. For he is the first one whom God raised from the dead, and he is the one who rules the kings of the earth. He is the one who loves us and who has freed us from the guilt of our sins by his blood when he died on the cross. \v 6 He is the one who has begun to rule over him kingdom; he has set us apart to be priests who come close to God and worship his Father as he commanded. It is Jesus Christ whom we must honor and praise forever. This is the truth.
