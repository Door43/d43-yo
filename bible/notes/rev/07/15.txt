\v 15 Because of this, they are in front of God's throne, and they worship him day and night in his temple. God, the one who sits on the throne, will protect them.
\v 16 As a result, they will never again be hungry. They will never again be thirsty. The sun will never again beat on them, nor will any heat scorch them.
\v 17 This is because the lamb who is at the throne will take care of them, just as a shepherd takes care of his sheep.

It will be as if he were wiping away all tears from their eyes.‚Äù
