\v 4 Come to the Lord Jesus. He is like the most  important stone in the foundation of a building, but he is living, not lifeless like a stone. Many people rejected him, but God chose him and considers him to be very valuable.
\v 5 And like men build houses with stones, God is joining you together like a building in which his Spirit lives. He is doing this in order that youâ€”like the priests who offer sacrifices at the altar, might do things that please God because Jesus Christ has died for you.
