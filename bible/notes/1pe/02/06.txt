===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Scripture says this** - > "God caused the following to be written down about Christ"
  * **Behold** - "I am telling you something important" or "Listen!" The word “behold” here alerts us to pay attention to the surprising information that follows. Your language may have a way of doing this.  
  * **a corner stone, chief and chosen and precious** - AT: "most important corner stone" (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hendiadys]])
