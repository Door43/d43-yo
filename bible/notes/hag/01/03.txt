\v 3 And so the word of Yahweh came by the hand of Haggai the prophet and said,
\q
\v 4 "Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your finished houses, 
\q while this house lies ruined?
\q
\v 5 So now Yahweh of hosts says this: 
\q 'Consider your ways!
\q
\v 6 You have sown much seed, but bring in little harvest; you eat but do not have enough; 
\q you drink but cannot get drunk. You wear clothes but cannot warm yourselves, 
\q and the wage earner earns money only to put it into a bag full of holes!'

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the hand of Haggai - **"came through the words (or 'mouth') of Haggai" Haggai was God's messenger or spokesman. See (Metonym) and (Synecdoche).
  * **"Is it a time for you yourselves to live in your finished houses, -**  See (Rhetorical Question). "It is not time for you to be living in the houses that you have built for yourselves,"
  * **while this house lies ruined? -**  "while this house lays in destruction!" See (Metonymy). The word house here refers to the temple of God. The city and the temple had been destroyed many years earlier and people rebuilt strong houses for themselves but did not rebuild God's temple.
  * **but cannot get drunk. -**  "but you are still thirsty." The word "drunk" may mean 'satisfied'.
  * **You wear clothes but cannot warm yourselves, and the wage earner earns money only to put it into a bag full of holes!' -**  "You do not find peace and prosperity in your lives, no matter how hard you try." See (Doublet) and (Metonymy). God is saying that whatever they are doing, they do not prosper and are not content. God is not blessing their efforts and labor.
