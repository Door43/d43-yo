\v 4 Jeroboamâ€™s wife did so; she left and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes had failed because of his age.
\v 5 Yahweh said to Ahijah, "Look, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to seek advice from  you regarding her son, for he is sick. Say such and such to her, because when she comes, she will act as if she were some other woman."
