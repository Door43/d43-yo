\v 14 Also, Yahweh will raise up a king of Israel who will cut off the family of Jeroboam on that day. Today is that day, right now.
\v 15 For Yahweh will attack Israel as a reed is shaken in the water, and he will root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their ancestors. He will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they have made their Asherim and provoked Yahweh to anger.
\v 16 He will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, the sins that he has committed, and through which he has led Israel to sin."
