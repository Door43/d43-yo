===== Translation Notes: =====

This begins a summary of bronze items that Huram made for the temple.

  * **shovels**  - Priests used the shovels to remove and carry ashes of the burned sacrifices.
  * **sprinkling bowls**  - These bowls held the blood of sacrificed animals. The blood from the bowls was then sprinkled on the altar or elsewhere as part of a ceremony.
  * **he finished all the work that he did**  - He refers to Huram.
  * **temple of Yahweh:**  - Here the colon (:) indicates that a list or a brief description of all the work Huram did, will follow.
  * **the two pillars, and the bowl like capitals that were on top of the two pillars, and the two sets of decorative latticework to cover the two bowl like capitals that were on top of the pillars.**  (See how you translated verses 15-22). Since the list will continue in the next verses, you could leave out the word "and". You could then separate the items with semicolons (;). You can also simplify the list and not include as many details, since the details were discussed in previous verses. AT: "the two pillars and the bowl like capitals; the two sets of decorative latticework for the capitals;" You can use semicolons along with commas to clarify and differentiate the descriptions from the listed items.
  * **the bowl like capitals**  - The capitals are compared to the shape of bowls. Each capital is shaped like a bowl. (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile|Simile]])
  * **capital**  - see 7:19)
