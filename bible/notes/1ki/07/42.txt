===== Translation Notes: =====

The author continues to list items for the temple that were made of bronze.

  * **He made the**  - Since the summary list of things Huram made continues here, you can leave out these words. You may leave it if you want to start a new sentence.
  * **four hundred**  - or 400. Decide how you want to translate numbers. (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers|Translate Numbers]])
  * **pomegranate**  - see :18
  * **latticework**  - see :15
  * **decorative latticework:**  - Here the colon (:) indicates that a description of the latticework will follow.
  * **and the ten stands**  - If you are continuing the list, you may leave out the word "and" in this phrase for verse 43. See how you proceeded in verse 41 and decide how you want to continue.
  * **stands**  - see :27
