===== Translation Notes: =====

The author writes about the bronze basins.

  * **Huram made ten basins of bronze. One basin could hold water for forty baths. Each basin was four cubits across, and one basin on each of ten stands.**  - AT: Huram made ten bronze basins for the ten stands, one basin for each stand. Each basin was four cubits across and could hold water for forty baths.
  * **forty**  - or 40. Decide how you want to translate numbers (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:translate_numbers|Translate Numbers]])
  * **bath**  - (See: [[:yo:obe:other:biblicalvolume|biblical volume]])
  * **cubit**  - (See: [[:yo:obe:other:biblicaldistance|biblical distance]])
  * **He made**  - He refers to Huram and his helpers.
  * **He made**  - It would be better to say "He placed" (UDB), "He set", or "He put." When he was done making the stands he moved them and put them by the temple.
  * **He made five stands on the south-facing side of the temple and five on the-facing side of the temple.**  It is inferred that the temple faced east. If we looked at the front of the temple, we would be facing west. To our right would be north and to our left would be south. AT: He placed five of the stands on the south side of the temple and five stands on the north side.
  * **the sea**  - This refers to the large, round, bronze, water tank that Huram made. (See 7:23)
  * **on the east corner, facing toward the south of the temple.**  - AT: "at the southeast corner of the temple."
