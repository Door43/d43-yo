===== Translation Notes: =====

The author continues to list items for the temple that were made of gold.

    * **socket** - a hinge or joint that allows a door to swing open or to close
    * **were all made** - AT: "The workers had made the cups, lamp trimmers, basins, spoons and incense burners of pure gold. The workers had also made the gold sockets for the doors of the most holy place and gold sockets for the doors of the main hall of the temple." Since this is a listing of items that the workers already completed, use "the workers had made" instead of "the workers made." (See [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_verbs]])
    * **verse 50** - The list of gold items continues. The following AT can be used instead of the AT noted above. If you ended the previous verse (49) with a semicolon (;), the first word of this verse does not need to be capitalized. A semicolon (;) can also be used after "incense burners" to separate the items of "pure gold" that were listed from those noted as just "gold" items. AT: "the pure gold cups, lamp trimmers, basins, spoons and incense burners; the gold hinges for the most holy place and the gold hinges for the doors of the main hall of the temple."
