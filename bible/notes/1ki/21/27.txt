\v 27 After Elijah finished talking to Ahab, Ahab tore his clothes \add to show that he was sorry for all the sins that he had committed\add*. He put on rough clothes that were made from sacks, and he refused to eat anything. He even wore those rough clothes made from sacks when he slept, to show that he was sorry.
\p
\v 28 Then Yahweh said this to Elijah:
\v 29 "I have seen \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that Ahab is now very sorry for all the evil things that he has done. So the things that I promised to do to his \add family\add* will not happen while he is still alive. I will cause them to happen after his son becomes king. Then those things will happen to his family." \f + \ft metonymy \f*

\v 27 When Ahab heard these words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his body and fasted,
and lay in sackcloth and became very sad.
\v 28 Then the word of Yahweh came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
\v 29 "Do you see how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the coming disaster in his days; it is in his son’s day that I will bring disaster on his family."
