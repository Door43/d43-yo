===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **The archer will not stand** - or "The archer will fall".  See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]]
    * **the fast runner will not escape**  - or "the fast runner will be caught/captured".  See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
    * **the horseman will not save himself**  - or "the horseman will fall prey/be defeated". See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] and [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
    * **Even the bravest warriors will flee naked** - The "flee naked" here might, or might not, be a [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]].  The UDB seems to interpret it this way.  Do prefer a literal translation though.
