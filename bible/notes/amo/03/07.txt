    * **Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing, except he reveals ..** - or "The Lord Yahweh will first reveal ... before doing something".   But prefer the literal "nothing, except" for emphasis.  See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]] 
    * **The lion has roared; who will not fear?**  - This is a Rhetorical Question.  The "will not" could also be translated "dare not".
    * **The Lord Yahweh has spoken; who will not prophesy?**  - This is a Rhetorical Question.  The "will not" could also be translated "dare not".
