\v 4 Listen to this, you who trample the needy
\q and remove the poor of the land.
\v 5 They say,
\q "When will the new moon be over,
\q so we can sell grain again?
\q And the Sabbath, when will it be over,
\q so that we can market wheat?
\q We will make the measure small
\q and increase the price,
\q as we cheat with false scales,
\q
\v 6 So that we can sell bad wheat and buy the poor for silver,
\q the needy for a pair of sandals."

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **When will the new moon be over, so we can sell grain again?**  - The idea is that those asking the question are impatient for the religious feast to be over.   See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]
    * **And the Sabbath, when will it be over, so that we can market wheat?**  - Same idea.  See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]] and [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]
