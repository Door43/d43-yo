===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Go to Bethel and sin, to Gilgal and multiply sin**  - See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and sarcasm.  It is ironic that they sin so much yet they are still religious enough to offer all of their sacrifices as if they were holy.
    * **Offer a thanksgiving sacrifice with bread ... for this pleases you** - This is also [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]] and sarcasm.
