===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:yo:obe:kt:hour]]
  * [[:yo:obe:kt:godthefather]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

At Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives Jesus has left Peter, James, and John to stay alert to pray.

  * **this hour might pass** - "he might be strengthened to endure the suffering he was experiencing"
  * **Abba** - "Abba" is a Greek term that is used by children to address their father. It implies a close relationship. Since it already addresses Father, it might be important to keep the Greek term, "Abba." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:translate_unknown]])
  * **Remove this cup from me** - The cup refers to the wrath of God Jesus must endure. (See: [[en:bible:team-info:training:quick-reference:figures:metaphor ]])
