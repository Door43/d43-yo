\v 4 Jesus \add knew that they refused to believe in him\add*. So he said to them, "\add It is certainly true that\add* people honor \add me and other\add* prophets \add in other places, but\add* not in our hometowns! Even our relatives and the people who live in our own houses do not honor us!"
\p
\v 5 \add So\add*, although he healed a few sick people there by touching them, he \add decided\add* not to perform many \add other\add* miracles \add in Nazareth\add* because the people there did not believe that he was the Messiah.
\v 6 He was amazed that they did not believe \add in him\add*.


\p Jesus \add and his disciples\add* went from town to town \add in that region\add* teaching \add the people\add*.
