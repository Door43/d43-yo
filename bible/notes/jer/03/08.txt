\v 8 The people of Judah saw what I did to them. But they are just like the people of Israel. They are not afraid \add of what I will do to them\add*. They also \add have turned away from me and are worshiping idols like\add* women who abandon their husbands and go to other men \f + \ft metaphor \f*.
\v 9 They thought that worshiping idols did not matter to me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not really done that. \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v8 So I sent the people of Israel away to other countries, like a man writes a note saying that he is divorcing his wife and then sends his wife away because she has committed adultery. The people of Judah saw what I did to them, but they are just like the people of Israel. They are not afraid of what I will do to them. They also have turned away from me and are worshiping idols like women who abandon their husbands and go to other men .
\v 9 They didn't care that worshiping idols offended me, so they have made the entire land unacceptable to me by worshiping idols of wood and stone.
\v 10 The people of Judah have pretended to return to me, but they have not really done that. This is true because I, Yahweh, have said it."

\v 8 So I saw that for all these reasons that she committed adultery. Apostate Israel! I sent her out and gave her a decree of divorce. But her treasonous sister Judah did not fear, 
and went out and also acted like a promiscuous woman!
\v 9 It mattered nothing to her that she defiled the land, so they made idols from the stone and the tree.
\v 10 Then after all of this, neither did her faithless sister Judah return to me with all her heart, but with a lie!—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
