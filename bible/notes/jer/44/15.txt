\v 15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were burning incense to other gods, and all the women who were in the great assembly, and all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros answered Jeremiah.
\v 16 They said, â€œAbout the word that you have told us in Yahweh's name: We will not listen to you.
\v 17 For we will certainly do all the things that we said we would do: burn incense to the Queen of Heaven and pour out drink offerings to her just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Then we will be filled with food and will prosper, wthout experiencing any disaster.
