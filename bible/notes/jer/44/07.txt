\v 7 So now Yahweh, the God of hosts and the God of Israel, says this: Why are you doing great wickedness against yourselves? Why are you causing yourselves to be cut off from among Judahâ€”men and women, children and babies? No remnant of you will be left.
\v 8 By your wickedness you have offended me with the deeds of your hands, by burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, where you are going to live. You are going there so that you will be destroyed and be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth.
