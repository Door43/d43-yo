\v 11 Therefore, this is what I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, the God whom you Israelites \add say you belong to\add*, say: I am determined to cause all of you to experience disasters and to get rid of everyone in Judah.
\v 12 You people from Judah who have survived were determined to come and live here in Egypt. So I will get rid of all of you here in Egypt. Every one of you will die, including those who are important and those who are not important. Some of you will be killed by your enemies' swords, some will die from famines. You will become people whom others curse, be horrified about, and make fun of.

\v 11 Therefore Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: "See, I am about to set my face against you to bring disaster to you and to destroy all of Judah.
\v 12 For I will take the remnant of Judah that have set out to go to the land of Egypt to live there. I will do this so that they will all perish in the land of Egypt. They will fall by sword and famine. From the least to the greatest they will perish by sword and famine. They will die and will become an object of swearing, cursing, reproaching, and a horrible thing.
