<usfm>
\q
\v 8 Why do you say, “We are wise! And the Law of Yahweh is with us”?
\q Indeed, see! The deceitful pen of the scribes has created deceit.
\q
\v 9 The wise men will be ashamed. They are dismayed and trapped.
\q See! They reject Yahweh's word, so what use is their wisdom?
\q
\v 10 So I will give their wives to others, and their fields to those who will possess them,
\q for from the youngest to the greatest, all of them are exceedingly greedy! From the prophet to the priest, all of them practice deceit.
