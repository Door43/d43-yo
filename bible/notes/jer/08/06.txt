\q
\v 6 I paid attention and listened, but they did not speak right; no one was sorry for his wickedness,
\q no one who says, “What have I done?” All of them go where they wish,
\q like a stallion rushing toward battle.
\q
\v7 Even the stork in heaven knows the right times; and the doves, swifts, and cranes.
\q They go on their migrations at the right time, but my people do not know Yahweh's decrees.
