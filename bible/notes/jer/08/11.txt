\q
\v 13 I will allow their enemies to take away the figs and grapes that the people would have harvested from their fields. Their fruit trees will all wither.

\q
\v 11 For they treated the fracture of the daughter of my people as if it were a trvial thing.
\q They said, “Peace, Peace,” but there was no peace.
\q
\v 12 Were they ashamed when they practiced abominations? They were not ashamed; they had no humility.
So they will fall at the time of their punishment, with those who have already fallen . They will be overthrown, says Yahweh.
\q
\v 13 I will remove them completely. This is Yahweh’s declaration. There will be no grapes on the vine, nor will there be figs on the fig trees. For the leaf will wither, and 
what I have given to them will pass away.
