\v 4 This is what you must say to him: ‘Yahweh says this: See, what I built, I am now tearing down. What I planted, I am now pulling up. This is true over all the earth.
\v 5 But are you hoping for great things for yourself? Do not hope for that. For see, disaster is coming on all humanity'—this is Yahweh’s declaration, 'but I am giving you your life as your plunder everywhere you will go.'"
