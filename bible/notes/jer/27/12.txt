\v 12 So I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah and gave him this message: “Place your necks into the yoke of the king of Babylon and serve him and his people, and you will live.
\v 13 Why will you die—you and your people—by the sword, famine, and plague, just as I have declared about the nation that refuses to serve the king of Babylon?
