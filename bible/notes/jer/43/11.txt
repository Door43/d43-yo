\v 11 For he will come and attack the land of Egypt. Anyone who is assigned to death will be given to death. Anyone who is assigned to captivity will be taken captive. And anyone who is assigned to the sword will be given to the sword.
\v 12 Then I will light a fire in the temples of Egypt's gods. Nebuchadnezzar will burn them or capture them. He will clean out the land of Egypt just as shepherds clean vermin off their clothes. He will go out from that place in victory.
\v 13 He will break the stone pillars at Heliopolis in the land of Egypt. He will burn the temples of Egypt's gods.
