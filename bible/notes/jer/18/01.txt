\v 1 This is the word of Yahweh that came to Jeremiah and said,
\v 2 “Arise and go out to the potter’s house, for I will have you hear my word there.”
\v 3 So I went out to the potter’s house, and behold! The potter was working on the potter's wheel.
\v 4 But the object of clay that he was molding was ruined in his hand, so he changed his mind and made another object that seemed good in his eyes to do.
