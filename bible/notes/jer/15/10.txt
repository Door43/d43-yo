\v 10 I said to my mother, "I am very sad;
\q1 I wish that you had not given birth to me;
\q2 everyone in this land opposes me and quarrels with me.
\q1 I am not a person who lends \add money to people and threatens to sue\f + \ft Or: harm \f* them if they do not pay me back when they should\add*,
\q2 and I am not a person who borrows \add money from others and then refuses to pay it back\add*,
\q1 but everyone \f + \ft hyperbole \f* curses me."
\p
\v 11 But Yahweh replied to me,
\q1 "Jeremiah, I will take care of you.
\q1 And at times when your enemies have troubles and disasters,
\q2 they will \add come to you and\add* plead for you \add to help them\add*.
\q1
\v 12 And Judah's enemies, who are \add as strong as\add* iron or bronze, \add will attack Judah\add* from the north,
\q2 no one will be able to stop them.
