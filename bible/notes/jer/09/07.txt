<usfm>
\q
\v 7 So Yahweh of hosts says this: See, I am about to test them. I will examine them.
\q For how else should I act for the daughter of my people?
\q
\v 8 Their tongue is a sharpened arrow; it speaks unfaithful things.
\q With their mouth they proclaim peace with their neighbors, but with their hearts they lie in wait for them.
\q
\v 9 Should I not punish them because of these things?—this is Yahweh’s declaration—
\q Should I not avenge myself on a nation that is like this?
