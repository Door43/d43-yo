===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 "My head feels like a spring of water, and my eyes are like a fountain of tears.
\q Since I cry night and day for all of my people who have been killed by their enemies.
\q
\v 2 I wish that I could leave my people and forget them, and go and live in a shack in the desert,
\q because they have not remained faithful to Yahweh; they are a mob of people who deceive others.
\q
\v 3 They use their tongues to tell lies like people shoot arrows with bows.
\q They are not powerful because they are faithful, but go about doing wicked things. "They do not know me," Yahweh has said.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\c 9
\q
\v 1 If only my head could produce water, and my eyes be a fountain of tears!
\q For I wish to weep day and night for those among the daughter of my people who have been killed.
\q
\v 2 If only someone would give me a place for travelers in the wilderness to stay, where I could go to abandon my people.
\q If only I could leave them, since all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors!
\q
\v 3 For they say false things with their tongues, which are their deceitful bows, but they are not great in faithfulness on the earth.
\q They go out from wicked act to another. They do not know me—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
