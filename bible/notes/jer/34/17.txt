\v 17 Therefore Yahweh says this: "You yourselves have not listened to me. You should have proclaimed freedom, every one of you, to your brothers and fellow Israelites. So look I am about to proclaim freedom to you"—this is Yahweh’s declaration, "freedom for the sword, the plague, and famine, for I am going to make you tremble in the sight of every kingdom on earth.
\v 18 Then I will deal with the people who have transgressed my covenant, who did not keep the words of the covenant that they established before me. They cut a bull in two and walked between its parts.
\v 19 Then the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the eunuchs and the priests, and all the people of the land walked between the parts of the bull.
