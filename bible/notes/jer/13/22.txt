<usfm>
\q
\v 22 Then you might say in your heart, “Why are these things happening to me?”
\q It will be for the multitude of your iniquities that your skirts are raised up and you have been raped.
\q
\v 23 Can the people of Cush change their skin color, or a leopard change its spots?
\q If so, then you yourself, although accustomed to wickedness, would be able to do good.
\q
\v 24 So I will scatter them like chaff that perishes in the desert wind.
