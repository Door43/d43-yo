\v 12 So you must speak this word to them:
‘Yahweh the God of Israel says this: "Every jar will be filled with wine." They will say to you, ‘Do we not indeed know that every jar will be filled with wine?’
\v 13 So say to them, ‘Yahweh says this: See, I am about to fill with drunkenness every inhabitant of this land, the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\v 14 Then I will smash each man against the other, fathers and children together—this is Yahweh’s declaration. I will not pity them or have compassion, and I will not spare them from destruction.
