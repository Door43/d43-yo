Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of this city to indicate that they are now the kings of Judah. Their armies will attack and break down the walls of this city, and they will do the same thing to all the other towns in Judah.
\v 16 I will punish my people because of all the evil things that they have done; they have abandoned me and they offer offerings of worship to false gods. They worship idols that they have made with their own hands!

\v 15 For I am calling all the tribes of the northern kingdoms," declares Yahweh. "They will come, and everyone will set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all the walls that surround it, and against all the cities of Judah.
\v 16 I will declare my judgments against them for all their evil in forsaking me, in burning incense to other gods, and in worshiping what they made with their own hands.
