====== Jeremiah 35:5-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 5 I set jugs of wine in front of them and urged them to drink some,
\v 6 but they refused. They said, "We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, commanded us, saying 'You and your descendants must never drink wine.
\v 7 And you must not build houses or plant vineyards or other crops. Instead, you must always live in tents. If you obey those commands, you all will live for many years in this land.'
</usfm>

<usfm>
\v 5 I set jugs of wine and some cups in front of them and urged them to drink some,
\v 6 but they refused. They said, "We do not drink wine, because our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab, commanded us, saying 'You and your descendants must never drink wine.
\v 7 And you must not build houses or plant vineyards or other crops. Instead, you must always live in tents. If you obey those commands, you all will live for many years in this land.'

<usfm>
\v 5 Then I placed bowls and cups full of wine in front of the Rechabites and said to them, “Drink some wine.”
\v 6 But they said, “We will not drink any wine, for our ancestor, Jonadab son of Rechab, commanded us, ‘Do not drink any wine, neither you nor your descendants, forever.
\v 7 Also, do not build any houses, sow any seeds, or plant any vineyards; this is not for you. For you must live in tents all your days, so that you might live many days in the land where you are staying as foreigners.’
</usfm>
