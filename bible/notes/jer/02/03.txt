\q
\v23 How do you say, ‘I am not defiled! I have not walked after the Baals!’
\q Look at your way in the valley! Understand what you have done, you swift camel whirling on its way!
\q
\v24 You wild ass, used to the desert, longing for life and panting after the wind!
\q Who turns her around when she is in heat? Anyone seeking her does not tire themselves. They will go out to her in her month.
\q
\v 25 You must restrain your foot from being bare and your throat from thirst!
\q But you have said, “It is hopeless! No – for I have loved strangers and will go after them!”
