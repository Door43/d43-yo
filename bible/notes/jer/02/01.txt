\p
\v 1 The word of Yahweh came to me and said,
\q
\v 2 “Go and proclaim in the ears of Jerusalem. Say, ‘Yahweh says this:
\q I have called to mind on your behalf the covenant faithfulness in your youthfulness, your love at time when we were engaged,
\q when you went after me in the wilderness, the land that was not sown.
\q
\v 3 Israel is holy to Yahweh, the first fruits of the harvest!
\q Anyone who ate from the first fruits were sinning! Evil will come on them—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
