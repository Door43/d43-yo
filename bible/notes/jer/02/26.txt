<usfm>
\q
\v 26 Like the shame of a thief when he is found, so the house of Israel will be ashamed—
\q they, their kings, their princes, and their priests and prophets!
\q
\v 27 These are the ones who say to the tree, “You are my father,” and to the stone, “You gave birth to me.”
\q For their back faces me and not their faces. Nevertheless, they say in the time of troubles, “Arise and save us!”
\q
\v 28 Yet where are the gods that you made for yourselves? Let them arise if they wish to save you in your time of troubles,
\q for your idols equal your cities in number, Judah!
