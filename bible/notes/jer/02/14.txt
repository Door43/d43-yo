\q
\v 14 Is Israel a slave? Was he not born at home? So why has he become plunder?
\q
\v 15 Young lions roared against him. They made a lot of noise and made his land a horror!
\q His cities are destroyed without any inhabitants.
\q
\v 16 Also, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes shave your skull and make slaves out of you!
