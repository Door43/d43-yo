\v 4 Hear the word of Yahweh, house of Jacob and every family in the house of Israel:
\q
\v 5 Yahweh says this: What did your fathers find wrong with me, that they went far from following me?
\q That they went after useless idols and became useless themselves?
\q
\v 6 For have they not said, “Where is Yahweh, who brought us up from the land of Egypt?
\q Where is Yahweh, who led us to the wilderness, into the land of the Arabah, 
\q into a pit in a land of drought and deep darkness, 
\q a land through which no one passes and where no one lives?”
