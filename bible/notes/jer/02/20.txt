===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 Long ago, you stopped obeying me \f + \ft metaphor \f*, and you would not allow me to lead you \f + \ft metaphor \f*;
\q2 you refused to worship me.
\q1 Instead, you worship idols that are under trees on the top of every hill,
\q2 and your young women have sex with \f + \ft euphemism \f* \add men at those places\add*.
\q1
\v 21 \add It is as though\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* you were a grapevine that I planted
\q2 when it was a cutting from a very good vine.
\q1 So now it is disgusting that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* you have become like a rotten worthless vine.
\q1
\v 22 Your guilt from your sins is like \f + \ft metaphor \f* very bad stains on a cloth,
\q2 and you cannot get rid of those stains even by using very strong soap.
\q1 \add This is true because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it.

<usfm>
\q
\v 20 For I broke your yoke that you had in ancient days; I tore your fetters off you. Still you said,
\q “I will not serve!” since you bowed down on every high hill and beneath every leafy tree, you adulterer.
\q
\v 21 But I myself had planted you as a choice vine, a completely true seed.
\q Yet how you have changed towards me, a disloyal one from a foreign vine!
\q
\v 22 For even if you clean yourself in the river or wash with strong soap,
\q your iniquity is a stain before me—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
