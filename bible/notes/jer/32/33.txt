<usfm>
\v 33 My people have turned away from me and have refused to return to me. Even though I taught them things many times, they would not pay attention to what I taught them, and they would not obey me.
\v 34 They have set up their detestable idols even in my own \f + \ft metonymy \f* temple and defiled it\f + \ft Or: caused it become a place that is unacceptable for people to worship me \f*.
\v 35 They have built shrines to \add honor\add* Baal in Ben-Hinnom Valley \add outside Jerusalem\add*, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to their god Molech. I never commanded them to do such horrible deeds. I never even thought that anyone might do such a terrible thing. And by doing it they have caused all the people of Judah to \add be guilty of having\add* sinned."

\v 33 They turned their backs to me instead of their faces, though I had eagerly taught them. I tried to teach them, but not one of them listened in order to receive correction.
\v 34 Then they placed their detestable things in the house in order to pollute it, the house where my name was called.
\v 35 Next they built shrines for Baal in the Valley of Ben Hinnom in order to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech, something that I did not command them to do, something that never even was thought of in my heartâ€”this disgusting thing for them to do in order to make Judah sin.
