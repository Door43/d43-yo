\q
\v 27 I have made you, Jeremiah, a refiner of my people, so you will inspect and test their ways.
\q
\v 28 They are all the most stubborn of people, who go about slandering others.
\q All of them are bronze and iron, acting corruptly.
\q 
\v 29 The bellows are scorched by their fire; the lead is consumed in their flame.
\q They keep on refining themselves in vain, for the evil is not removed.
\q
\v 30 They will be called "rejected silver," for Yahweh has rejected them!’”
