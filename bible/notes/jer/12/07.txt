\v 7 I have abandoned my house; I have forsaken my inheritance.
\q I have given my own beloved people into her enemies' hands.
\q
\v 8 My inheritance has become to me like a lion in a thicket;
\q she sets herself against me with her own voice, so I have her.
\q
\v 9 My prized possession is a hyena, and birds of prey circle around her overhead.
\q Go, gather all the living creatures in the fields, and bring them in to eat them.
