\v 24 It will happen that if you truly listen to me—this is Yahweh’s declaration—and do not bring a load to the gates of this city on the Sabbath day but instead sanctify the Sabbath day and not do any work on it—
\v 25 then kings, princes, and those who sit on David's throne will come to the gates of this city in chariots and with horses,  they and their leaders, men of Judah and 
inhabitants of Jerusalem. And this city will remain forever.
