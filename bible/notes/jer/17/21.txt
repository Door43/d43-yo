\v 21 Yahweh says this: "Keep your lives and do not carry a burden on the day of Sabbath to bring it to the gates of Jersusalem.
\v 22 And do not bring a load out from your house on the Sabbath day. So not do any work, but sanctify the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors to do.
\v 23 They did not listen or pay attention, but stiffened their neck so they would not hear me nor accept discipline.
