\v 26 And people will come \add to Jerusalem\add* bringing offerings to be completely burned \add on the altar\add* and other offerings. They will bring to the temple grain offerings and incense and offerings to thank \add me\add*. People will bring these offerings from the towns in Judah and the villages near Jerusalem and from the land where the tribe of Benjamin lives and from the western foothills and from the desert in the south.
\v 27 But if you do not pay attention to what I say, and if you refuse to dedicate the Sabbath days to me, and if you continue to carry loads through these gates into the city on Sabbath days, I will burn these gates completely. The fire will spread to the palaces, and no one will be able to put out that fire."~'~"
