<usfm>
\p
\v 8 Behold! You are trusting in deceitful words that do not help you.
\v 9 Do you steal, kill, and commit adultery? And do you swear deceitfully and offer incense to Baal and walk after other gods whom you have not known?
\v 10 Then do you come and stand before me in this house where my name is proclaimed and say, ‘We are saved,” so you can do all of these abominations?
\v 11 Is not this house, which carries my name, a den of bandits in your eyes? See! I also have seen this—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
