\v 21 Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel says this: Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and the meat from them.
\v 22 For  when I brought your ancestors out from the land of Egypt, I did not require anything from them; I gave them no command about matters of burnt offerings and sacrifices.
\v 23 I only gave them this command: ‘Listen to my voice, and I will be your God and you will be my people. So walk in all the ways that I am commanding you, so that it may go well with you.’
