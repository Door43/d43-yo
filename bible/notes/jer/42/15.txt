\v 15 Then now listen to this word of Yahweh, remnant of Judah. Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, says this: If you actually set out to go to Egypt, to go and live there,
\v 16 then the sword that you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt. The famine that you are worrying about will pursue you to Egypt. And you will die there.
\v 17 So it will happen that all the men who set out to go to Egypt to live there will die by sword, famine, or plague. There will be no survivor of them, no one to escape the disaster that I will bring on them.
