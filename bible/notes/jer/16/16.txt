\v 16 See! I will send for many fisherman"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—"so they will fish the people out. After this I will send for many hunters so they will hunt for them among all 
the mountains and hills, and in rock crevices.
\v 17 For my eye is on all their ways; they cannot be hidden from before me. Their iniquity cannot be concealed from before my eyes.
\v 18 I will first pay back double for their iniquity and sin for their polluting of my land with their disgusting idol figures, and for their filling my inheritance with their disgusting idols.
