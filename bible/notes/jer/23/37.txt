===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply \add when you talked to him\add*? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, '\add What I told you\add* is a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh,' you should say to him, 'You have continued to say, "I received a prophecy\f + \ft Or: message \f* from Yahweh" even though I told you to not claim that you have received prophecies\f + \ft Or: messages \f* from Yahweh.'
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you \add false prophets\add*. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 This is what you should ask each prophet: 'What did Yahweh reply when you talked to him? What is he saying to us?'
\v 38 If he replies, 'What I told you is a prophecy from Yahweh' then let him know I will punish him, becasue I told my true prophets not to give any messages to this people right now.
\v 39 So I, Yahweh, will get rid of you false prophets. I will expel you from my presence. And I will get rid of this city that I gave to you and to your ancestors.
\v 40 I will cause people to make fun of you forever. People will never forget that you were disgraced."

\v 37 This is what you must say to a prophet: ‘What did Yahweh answer you? What did Yahweh declare?’
\v 38 And if you report a declaration from Yahweh, Yahweh says this: Because of your speaking this word, a declaration of Yahweh, when I sent a command to you and said,  
‘Do not say, "This is a declaration from Yahweh,’
\v 39 so see, I am about to pick you up and throw you away from me, along with the city that I gave you and your ancestors.
\v 40 Then I will put everlasting shame and insult on you that will not be forgotten.”
