\q1 When they solemnly declare something, they ask their gods \add to show that what they say is true\add*.
\q1 I gave my people everything that they needed,
\q2 but they often went to \add the shrines of their idols\add* and committed adultery there.
\q1
\v 8 Just like \f + \ft metaphor \f* well-fed male horses neigh, wanting sex with female horses,
\q2 each of the men desires to have sex with his neighbor's wife.

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Why should I pardon these people?
\q Your sons have abandoned me and have made oaths by what are not gods.
\q I fed them fully, but they committed adultery and took on the marks of a house of prostitution.
\q
\v 8 They were horses in heat. They roamed about wanting to have sex. Each man neighed to his neighbor's wife.
\q
\v 9 So should I not punish them? This is Yahwehâ€™s declaration.
\q Should my heart not avenge itself on a nation that is like this?
