\q
\v 1 “Rush about through the streets of Jerusalem, then look and think about this. Search in her city squares, too.
\q If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and seeking the truth,
\q then I will forgive Jerusalem.
\q
\v 2 Even if they are saying, ‘Yahweh lives,’ they are making false oaths.
\q
