\q
\v 10 Go up onto her vineyards' terraces and destroy. But do not bring complete destruction to them.
\q Trim their vines, since those vines do not come from Yahweh.
\q
\v 11 For the houses of Israel and Judah have completely betrayed me—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
\q
\v 12 They have denied me. They say, ‘He is not real.
\q Evil will not come on us, nor will we see sword or famine.
\q
\v 13 For the prophets have become as useless as the wind and there is no one else to declare Yahweh's messages to us. Let their threats come upon themselves.'"
