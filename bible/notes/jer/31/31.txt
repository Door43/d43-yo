\v 31 Look, the days are coming"—this is Yahweh’s declaration—"when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and Judah.
\v 32 It will not be like the covenant that I established with their fathers in the days when I took them by their hand to bring them out from the land of Egypt. Those were the days when 
they violated my covenant, although I was a husband for them"—this is Yahweh’s declaration.
