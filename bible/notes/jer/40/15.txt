\v 15 Later Johanan talked with Gedaliah privately. He said, "Allow me to go and murder Ishmael secretly. It would not be good \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* to allow him to come and murder you! If you are killed, what will happen to all the Jews who have returned to this area? They will be scattered, and the other people who remain in Judah will all be killed!"

\v 15 So Jonathan son of Kareah spoke privately to Gedaliah in Mitzpah and said, “Allow me to go kill Ishamael te son of Nethaniah. No one will suspect me. 
Why should he kill you? Why allow all of Judah that has been gathered to you to be scattered and the remnant of Judah destroyed?”
\v 16 But Gedaliah son of Ahikam said to Jonathan son of Kareah, “Do not do this thing, for you are telling lies about Ishmael.”
