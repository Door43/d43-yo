\v 5 When Jeremiah did not reply, Nebuzaradan said, “Go to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has put in charge of the cities of Judah. Stay with him among the people or go wherever it is good in your eyes to go.” The the commander of the king's bodyguards  gave him food and a gift, and then sent him away.
\v 6 So Jeremiah went to Gedaliah, son of Ahikam, at Mitzpah. He stayed with him among the people who were left behind in the land.
