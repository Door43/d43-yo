\v 27 "But you, my servant Jacob, do not fear. Do not be dismayed, Israel, for see, I am about to bring you back from far away, and your offspring from the land of their captivity. Then Jacob will return, find peace, and be secure, and there will be no one to terrify him.
\v 28 You, my servant Jacob, do not fear"—this is Yahweh’s declaration. "For I am with you, so I will bring complete destruction against all the nations where I scattered you. But I will not destroy you completely. Yet I will discipline youjustly and will certainly not leave you unpunished.”'"
