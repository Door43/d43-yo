\q
\v 10 I have heard rumors of terror from many people all around: ‘Report. We must report it.’ 
\q Everyone who is close to me watches for me to fall. 'Perhaps he can be fooled.
\q If so, we will defeat him and take vengeance on him.'
\q
\v 11 But Yahweh is with me like a powerful warrior, so the ones pursuing me will stagger. 
\q They will not defeat me. They will be greatly ashamed, for they will not succeed. 
\q They will have unending shame, never to be forgotten.
