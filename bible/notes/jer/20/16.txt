\v 16 Let that man be like the cities that Yahweh overthrew when he would not have mercy.
\q May he hear a cry for help in the dawn and the cry of battle at noontime.

\v 17 May this happen, since Yahweh he did not kill me in the womb or make my mother my tomb,
\q a pregnant womb forever.

\v 18 Why is it that I came out from the womb to see troubles and agony,
\q so that my days are filled with shame?‚Äù
