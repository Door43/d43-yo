\v 4 Then Jeremiah called Baruch son of Neriah, and Baruch wrote in a scroll, at Jeremiah's dictation of, all the words of Yahweh spoken to him.
\v 5 Next Jeremiah gave a command to Baruch. He said, â€œI am in prison and cannot go to Yahweh's house.
\v 6 So you must go and read from the scroll that you wrote at my dictation. On the day of the fast, you must read Yahweh's words in the hearing of the people in his house, and also in the hearing of all of Judah who have come from their cities. Proclaim these words to them.
