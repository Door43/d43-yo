\v 27 After the king had burned the scroll on which were written the messages that I had dictated to Baruch, Yahweh said this to me:
\v 28 "Get another scroll, and \add tell Baruch to\add* write everything again, the same messages that he had written on the scroll that the king burned.
\v 29 Then go to the king and say to him, 'Yahweh says this: You burned the scroll because \add you did not like\add* what was written on it, that the king of Babylon would surely \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* come \add with his army\add* and destroy this land and get rid of all the people and the animals.

\v 27 Then the word of Yahweh came to Jeremiah after the king had burned the scroll and the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation. It said,
\v 28 “Go back, take another scroll for yourself, and write in it all the words that were on the original scroll, the one  that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned.
\v 29 Then you must say this to Jehoiakim king of Judah: 'You burned that scroll! And you said, "Why have you written on it, 'The king of Babylon 
will certainly come and destroy this land, for he will destroy both man and beast in it'?’
