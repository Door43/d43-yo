\v 9 As for you, Solomon my son, obey the God of your father, and serve him with your whole heart and a willing spirit. Do this because Yahweh searches all hearts and understands every motivation of everyone's thoughts. If you seek him, he will be found by
you, but if you abandon him, he will reject you permanently.
\v 10 Realize that  Yahweh has chosen you to build this temple as his sanctuary. Be strong and do it."
