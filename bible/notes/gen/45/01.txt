\v 1 Joseph was not able to control his feelings any longer. He did not want to cry in front of his servants, so he said to them loudly, "All of you go outside!" After they went outside, there was no one else there with Joseph when he told his brothers who he was.
\v 2 He cried so loudly that the people of Egypt who were outside heard it, and even the people in the king's palace heard it.
\v 3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph! Is our father still alive?" But his brothers were not able to reply, because they were frightened because of what he said.

\v 1 Then Joseph could not control himself before all the servants who stood by him. He cried, "Every man must leave me." So no servant stood by him when Joseph made himself known to his brothers.
\v 2 He wept loudly, and the Egyptians heard it, and the house of Pharaoh heard of it.
\v 3 Joseph said to his brothers, "I am Joseph. Does my father still live?" His brothers could not answer him, for they were shocked in his presence.
