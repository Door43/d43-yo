\v 5 You know that we never praised you in order to get anything from you. And we never said anything to you to convince you to give us things. God knows that this is true!
\v 6 Neither did we ever try to get you or anyone else to honor us, although we could have demanded that you give us things because Christ had sent us to you.

\v 5 For we did not at any time use words as flattery, as you know, nor as a pretext for covetousness, God is witness,
\v 6 nor did we seek glory from people, either from you or from others, when we could have claimed privileges as apostles of Christ.
