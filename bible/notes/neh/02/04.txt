So I prayed to the God of heaven. \v 5 I replied to the king, "If it seems good to the king, and if your servant has done well in your sight, you could send me to Judah, to the city of my fathersâ€™ tombs, that I may rebuild it. \v 6 The king replied to me (and the queen was also sitting beside him), "How long shall you be away and when will you return?"
