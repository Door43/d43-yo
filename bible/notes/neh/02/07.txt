====== Nehemiah 02:7-8 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm> \v 7 I also said to the king, "If you are willing to do it, write letters for me to take to the governors of the province west of the \add Euphrates\add* River. Tell them to allow me to travel safely \add through their province\add* until I arrive in Judah. \v 8 Also, \add please write\add* a letter to Asaph, the man who takes care of your forest \add in that area\add*, telling him to give me timber to make the beams to support the gates of the fortress that is near the temple, and timber for making the walls of the city, and for building the house in which I \add will live\add*." The king did what I requested him to do, because my God was graciously\f + \ft Or: kindly \f* helping\f + \ft Or: acting for \f* me. \p </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 I also said to the king, "As a reward for my faithful service to you, please give me letters addressed to the governors who oversee the area beyond the Euphrates River. Please give them orders to allow me to travel safely through their province on my way to and from Judah. \v 8 Also, please write a letter to Asaph, who manages all the timber in your forest, and tell him to make beams to repair the gates of the fortress next to the temple, and to repair the walls of the city, and the house in which I will live." The king did what I requested him to do, because God was helping me get what I needed for these repairs.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 7 Then I said to the king, "If it have done well before the king, give me letters for the governors beyond the River, that they permit me to pass through their territories on my way to Judah. \v 8 Also give me a letter to Asaph the keeper of the kingâ€™s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress next to the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house in which I will live." \p So because the good hand of God was on me, the king granted me my requests. </usfm>
