\v 4 Then I prayed. I said, "Our God, hear us, because they are ridiculing us! Cause the words of their insults to fall back on them! Allow their enemies to come and capture them and force them to go to a foreign land!
\v 5 They are guilty; they have caused you to be angry while the people here who are building the wall are listening; so punish them!"
\p
\v 6 But after some time, we finished building the wall around the whole city, up to half as high as the first wall had been. We were able to do that because we worked very hard.

\v 5 They are guilty. Do not take away their guilt and let them answer for the sin they committed before you. With their insults, they are making those who are rebuilding the walls become very angry!"

\v 6 But after some time, the workers built the wall around the whole city to about half its total height.  They were able to accomplish this because they wanted to do the best work they could do.

\v 4 Hear, our God, for we are despised. Turn back their taunts on their own heads and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are prisoners. 
\v 5 Do not cover over their iniquity and do not erase their sin from before you, for they have provoked the builders to anger. 
\v 6 So we built the wall and all the wall was joined together to half its height, for the people had a desire to work.
