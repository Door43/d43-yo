\v 11 Yahweh, please hear this prayer of mine, and the prayers of all your people who are delighted to revere you \f + \ft metonymy \f*.

\v 10 We are your servants. We are the people whom you have delivered from slavery by your very great power. You did that because you are able to do whatever you desire.
\v 11 Yahweh, please hear my prayer, I who am your servant. Please hear the prayers of all your people who have great joy when they honor you for who you are and what you do. Now I pray you would give me success when I go to the king; and protect me as I make a request of the king that could put my life in jeopardy. Give me mercy."
