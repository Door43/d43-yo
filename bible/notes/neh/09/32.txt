\v 32 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the awesome God, who keeps his covenant and steadfast love, do not let all this hardship seem little to you that has come on us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our ancestors, and on all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until today.
\v 33 You are just in everything that has come on us, for you have dealt faithfully, and we have acted wickedly. 
\v 34 Our kings, our princes, our priests, and our ancestors have not kept your law, nor paid attention to your commandments or your covenant decrees by which you warned them.
