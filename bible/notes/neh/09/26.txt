\v 26 Then they became disobedient and they rebelled against you. They threw your law behind their backs. They murdered your prophets who had warned them to turn back to you, and they committed great blasphemies. 
\v 27 So you handed them over into the hand of their enemies, who made them suffer. And in the time of their suffering, they cried out to you and you heard them from heaven and many times you rescued them out of the hand of their enemies, because of your great mercies.
