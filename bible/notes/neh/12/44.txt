\v 44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms where they kept the money that people gave for the temple. They also were in charge of the tithes and the first part of the grain and fruit that was harvested each year. They also brought into the storerooms a part of the harvest from the fields for the priests and the descendants of Levi. This was done because the people of Judah were so happy to have servants serving in the house of Yahweh.
\v 45 The priests and Levites were serving Yahweh in their rituals to purify things, and the  musicians in the temple and the gatekeepers also did their work as King David and his son Solomon had declared that they should do.

\v 44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the contributions, the firstfruits, and the tithes, to gather into them the portions required  by the law for the priests and for the Levites. Each was assigned to work the fields near the towns. For Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who were standing before them.
\v 45 They performed the service of their God, and the service of purification, in keeping with the command of David and of Solomon his son, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers.
