The two groups \add faced each other\add*, one group replying to the other, during the time that they praised and thanked God. They did that just as King David, the man \add who served\add* God well, had instructed.
\v 25 These singers included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah.
\p The men who guarded the storerooms close to the gates \add of the temple\add* were Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub.
