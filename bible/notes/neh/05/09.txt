\v 9 Then I said to them, "What you are doing is terrible \f + \ft euphemism \f*! You certainly ought to \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* obey God and do what is right! If you did that, our enemies who do not have an awesome respect for Yahweh \add would see that we are doing what is right and\add* would not ridicule us.
\v 10 I and my fellow Jews and my servants have lent money and grain to people. But we all should stop charging interest on these loans.
\v 11 Also, you must give back to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive tree orchards, and their houses that you have taken from them. You must also give back to them the interest that you charged them when they borrowed money, grain, wine, and \add olive\add* oil from you, and you must do it today!"
