<usfm>
\v 1 On that day, when someone read to the people parts of the laws that \add God gave to\add* Moses, they read where it was written that no one from the Ammon people-group or the Moab people-group was ever to be allowed to be with God's people while they were gathered together \add to worship\add*.
\v 2 The reason for that was that the people of Ammon and the people of Moab did not give\f + \ft Or: sell \f* any food or water to the Israelites while \add the Israelites were going through their areas after they left Egypt\add*. Instead, the people of Ammon and Moab paid money to Balaam in order that he would curse the Israelites. But God commanded Balaam to bless the people, not to curse them.
\v 3 So when the people heard these laws \add being read to them\add*, they sent away all the people whose ancestors had come from other countries.

\v 1 On that day the priests read and the people listened, and the passage was read with the laws God gave Moses that said no Amonite or Moabite was ever to be allowed to come into the place where God's people worship.
\v 2 The reason for that was that the people of Ammon and the people of Moab did not give any food or water to the Israelites while the Israelites were going through their areas after they left Egypt. Instead, the people of Ammon and Moab paid money to Balaam to influence him to curse the Israelites. But God turned that attempt to curse Israel into a blessing.
\v 3 So when the people heard these laws being read to them, they sent away all the people whose ancestors had come from other countries.

\v 1 On that day they read the book of Moses in the hearing of the people. It was found written in it that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not come into the assembly of God, forever.
\v 2 This was because they had not come to the people of Israel with bread and with water, but they had hired Balaam to curse Israel. However, our God turned the curse into a blessing.
\v 3 As soon as they heard the law, they separated out from Israel every person of mixed ancestry.
