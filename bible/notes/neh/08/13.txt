<usfm>
\v 13 The next day, the leaders of the families and the priests and the Levites came together with Ezra to study carefully the laws that Yahweh had given to Moses.
\v 14 While they were doing that, they realized that Yahweh had told Moses to command the Israelite people to live in shelters during that month, \add to remember that their ancestors lived in shelters when they left Egypt\add*.
\v 15 They also learned that they should proclaim in Jerusalem and in all the towns that the people should go to the hills and cut branches from olive trees \add that they have planted\add* and from wild olive trees and from myrtle trees and palm trees and fig trees. They should make shelters from these branches, and live in those shelters during the festival, just as Moses wrote \add that they should do\add*.
