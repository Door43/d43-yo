    * **Shemaiah**  - one of the Jewish officials
    * **"Let us meet together in the house of God, inside the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. At night they are coming to kill you."**  - This would appear to Nehemiah's followers that he was hiding in the temple, a sign of weakness
    * **bold words**  - explanation
    * **"Would a man like me run away? And would a man like me go into the temple just so I might live? I will not go in."**  - These are two questions that mean "A man like me would not run away. And a man like me would not go into the temple just to stay alive. I will not go in." The questions do not expect an answer, but are used for emphasis. (see: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
