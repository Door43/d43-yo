And close the gates and put the bars across the doors \add late in each afternoon\f + \ft Or: before sunset \f*\add* while the gatekeepers are still guarding the gates." I also told them to appoint some people who lived in Jerusalem to be guards, and to assign some of them to be guards at certain places and to assign others to guard the area close to their own houses.

\v 3 I said to them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. And close the gates and put the bars across the doors only when  gatekeepers are guarding the gates." I also told them to appoint some people who live in Jerusalem to be guards, and to assign some of them to guard stations around the city, and some would guard near their own houses."
\p
\v 4 The city of Jerusalem covered a large area, but at that time not many people lived in the city, and they had not rebuilt any of the houses.

\v 3 And I said to them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until the sun is hot. While the gatekeepers are on guard, you may shut the doors and bar them. Appoint guards from those who live in Jerusalem, some at the place of their guard station, and some in front of their own homes." 
\v 4 Now the city was wide and large, but there were few people within it, and no houses had yet been rebuilt.

    * **them**  - meaning Nehemiah's brother, the Administrator of the city. and Hananiah, responsible for the citadel.
    * **sun is hot**  - "sun is high in the sky"
    * **While the gatekeepers are on guard**  - "if the gatekeepers are guarding the gate", meaning, if the gatekeepers are challenging those approaching.
    * **you may shut the doors and bar them** - "you may close the gates and lock them"
    * **Appoint guards from those who live in Jerusalem, some at the place of their guard station, and some in front of their own homes."**  - These are the criteria for guards: those who live here and those whose homes are nearby. Those who are not just hired, but have a vested interest in the security of that part of the city.
    * **Now the city was wide and large, but there were few people within it, and no houses had yet been rebuilt**  - meaning, the walled area was large. It was thinly populated. And people were still living in temporary shelter.
    * **no houses had yet been rebuilt**  - This may be an exaggeration to emphasise that the city was not in a finished state to house all the people. It is also a passive clause, which can be translated as an active clause. AT: "the people had not yet rebuilt many houses" (See: Hyperbole) (See: Active/Passive)
