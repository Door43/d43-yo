===== Translation Notes: =====
**That day will be a day of fury....battlements!** - This statement is to emphasize that God's judgment will be experienced by the people and cannot be escaped.  (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])

Where two words are joined together with "and" in verses 15 and 16, the same thought is expressed in two ways to emphasize the concept.  (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
