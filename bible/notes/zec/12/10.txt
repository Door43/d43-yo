\v 10 But I will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication upon the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, 
so they will look on me, the one they have pierced!" They will mourn for him, as one mourns for an only son, and lament
 for him like those who lament the death of a firstborn son.
\v 11 In that day the laments for Jerusalem will be like the laments of Hadad Rimmon in the plains of Megiddo.
