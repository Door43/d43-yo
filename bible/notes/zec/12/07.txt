\v 7 And I, Yahweh, will protect the tents of \add the soldiers in other places in\add* Judah before \add I rescue the people of Jerusalem\add*, in order that the leaders of Jerusalem \f + \ft doublet \f* will be honored more than \add the people in other places in\add* Judah are honored.
\v 8 At that time, I will protect \f + \ft metaphor \f* the people of Jerusalem. When that happens, even the weakest people in Jerusalem will be strong like \add King\add* David was. And the descendants \f + \ft metonymy \f* of David will \add rule the people\add* like I \add would\add*, as though an angel sent from me, Yahweh, was their leader.
\v 9 At that time, I will prepare to destroy all the nations that attack Jerusalem."

<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh will protect those who live in the other places in Judah before he rescues the people of Jerusalem, in order that people will not honor the descendants of David and those in Jerusalem more than the people in all the rest of Judah.
\v 8 At that time, Yahweh will protect everyone in Jerusalem. The weakest soldiers among them will be as strong as David was, and the descendants of David will be like God; they will lead the others like the angel of Yahweh himself.
\v 9 At that time, I will prepare to destroy all the armies that attack Jerusalem."

while the house of David will be like God, like the angel of Yahweh in front of them.
