<usfm>
\v 4 This is what Yahweh my God said to me: "\add I want you to\add* become a shepherd for a flock of sheep that are about to be slaughtered.
\v 5 The people who are going to buy the sheep will kill the sheep, and they will not be punished. Those who are selling the sheep say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' Even the shepherds do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow many of them \f + \ft hyperbole \f* to be captured by other people or by their king. Those who capture them will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of the people."

\v 5 The dealers in sheep will kill the sheep, and no one will punish them. Those who are sell the sheep will say, 'I praise Yahweh, because I will become rich!' And the shepherds the owners hire do not feel sorry for the sheep.
\v 6 And similarly, I no longer feel sorry for the people of this country. I am going to allow their shepherd, their king, to oppress them. They will ruin this country, and I will not rescue any of them."

\v 4 Thus said Yahweh my God, "Shepherd the flock meant for the slaughter!
\v 5 (The ones who buy them slaughter them and suffer no punishment, and the ones who sell them say, 
'Blessed be Yahweh! I have become rich!' for their own shepherds have not pitied them.)
\v 6 For I will no longer pity the inhabitants of the land!"—this is Yahweh's declaration. "See! I myself will make them encounter a people, so that each man will fall into his shepherd's hands and into his king's hands, and they will crush the land, but I will not rescue Judah from their hand.
