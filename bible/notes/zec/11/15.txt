\v 15 Then Yahweh said to me, "Take again the things that a foolish shepherd uses,
\v 16 because I am going to appoint a new king for the people, one who will not take care of my people. He will be like a foolish shepherd: he will ignore the dying sheep and those that have gotten lost. The healthy sheep he will not feed, but will instead butcher healthy sheep for his own food, and tear their hooves off.

\v 15 Yahweh said to me, "Again, take the instruments of a foolish shepherd for yourself,
\v 16 for Behold! I will raise up a shepherd in the land! He will not care for the perishing sheep. He will not seek out the sheep gone astray, 
nor heal the crippled sheep. He will not feed the sheep which stand firm, but will eat the flesh of the fattened sheep and tear off their hooves.
