\v 10 Then I took the staff that I had named 'Kindness' and I broke it. That \add showed that Yahweh\add* was annulling\f + \ft Or: canceling \f* the agreement that he had made with all the people-groups.
\v 11 So that agreement was ended immediately. And the men who bought and sold sheep who were watching me knew \add by seeing what I was doing\add* that I was giving them a message from Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 I told them, "If you think it is what you should do, pay me \add for taking care of the sheep\add*. If you do not think that is what you should do, do not pay me." So they paid me \add only\add* thirty pieces of silver.

\v 10 Then I took the staff that I had named 'Kindness,' and I broke it. Yahweh said, "That showed that I was annulling the covenant that I had made with all the tribes of Israel."
\v 11 So that covenant was ended on that very day. And the dealers who were watching me knew by seeing what I was doing that I was giving them a message from Yahweh.
\p
\v 12 I told them, "If you think it is right, pay me for my work. If you do not think it is right, do not pay me." So they paid me only thirty pieces of silver.
