===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **will be like the bowls before the altar.**  - "will be as sacred as the bowls used at the altar."
  * **every pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to Yahweh of hosts,**  - different types of pots and utensils were made especially to be used in the temple for the worship of Yahweh and for the sacrifices. These were considered sacred and not used for anything else. Yahweh will make big changes in the future. Prophetically, Yahweh is saying that he will be the God of the Gentiles as well as the Jews.
  * **Traders will no longer exist in the house of Yahweh**  - This common practice will be one of the many big changes Yahweh makes. This applies to the time Zechariah is writing about but it also has prophetic meaning.
