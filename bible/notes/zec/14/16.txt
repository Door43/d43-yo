\v 16 Then it will come about that all who remain from those nations that came against Jerusalem will instead go up from year to year to worship the king,
Yahweh of hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.
\v 17 And it will come about that if anyone from all the families of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Yahweh of hosts, then Yahweh will not bring up rain to them!
\v 18 And if the family of Egypt does not go up and come, then they will not receive rain. A plague from Yahweh will strike the nations that do not go up to keep the feast of tabernacles.
