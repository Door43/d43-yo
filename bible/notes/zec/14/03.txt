===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **as when he wages war on the day of battle!**  - AT: "just as he has battled in the past!"
  * **his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, **- "he/his" refers to Yahweh and in these prophetic verses, Jesus, who will literally stand on the mountain.
  * **The Mount of Olives will split into two parts, **- It seems that God caused an earthquake to split the mountain in half.  Jesus is no longer subject to the laws of nature so we do not know if he will need to move or how he would move.
