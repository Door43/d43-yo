====== Zechariah 02:8-9 ======

===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 8 The \add armies of the\add* nations that \add attacked you and\add* took away your valuable possessions have attacked those who are very precious to the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels [IDI]. So he says this about me: "After I have honored him and sent him to \add rebuke\add* the nations,
\v 9 \add it is as though\add* I will strike them with my fist, with the result that those who were their slaves will now take back those possessions from those who caused them to become slaves." And when that happens, you will know that the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels is the one who sent me.

\v 8 Yahweh, powerful commander of the angel armies, told me to go to the nations who took everything you owned, for those who harm you harm what is most precious to me!
\v 9 I must tell them that it is though I, a prophet, will raise my hand against them, then their own Jewish slaves will take back those possessions from them, who had captured them. And when that happens, you will know that Yahweh, powerful commander of the angel armies, is the one who sent me.
