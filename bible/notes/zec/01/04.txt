\v 4 Do not be like your ancestors. Prophets, who have now died, continually proclaimed to your ancestors that they should stop doing the evil things that they were always doing. But they refused to pay attention to what I said.
\v 5 Your ancestors have died and are now in their graves. Even the prophets did not live forever either.
\v 6 But the commands and the decrees that I had instructed my servants the prophets to tell themâ€”your ancestors did not obey them, so I punished them.

So then they repented and said that I, Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, had done to them what they deserved for their evil behavior, just like I had said I would do.'"

\v 4 Do not be like your fathers to whom the prophets cried out previously, saying, "Yahweh of hosts says this:
turn from your evil ways and wicked practices!" But they would not hear and did not pay attention to me.'" This is Yahweh's declaration.
\q
\v 5 Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, are they here forever?
\q
\v 6 But my words and my decrees that I commanded my servants the prophets, 
\q have they not overtaken your fathers? 
\m
So they repented and said, 'Yahweh of hosts's plans are made in keeping with his word and practice, and he has carried them out.'"
