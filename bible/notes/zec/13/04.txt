\v 4 At that time, the false prophets will be ashamed that they had any visions or dreams at all. They will no longer put on cloaks made with animal hair that prophets normally wear, because they will want the people to think that they were never really prophets at all.
\v 5 So each of them will say, 'I am not really a prophet; I am a farmer, and I have been a farmer on my land ever since I was a boy!'
\v 6 But others will see scars on their bodies and think that they cut themselves in order to please idols while they were worshiping them. So they will ask, 'Why do you have those scars?' And they will tell a lie: 'I was injured in a quarrel at my friend's house.'"

\v 4 Then it will happen in that day that each prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies and, so that they might deceive, they will no longer wear a hairy cloak.
\v 5 For he will say, 'I am not a prophet! I am a man who works the soil, for the land became my work while I was still a young man!'
\v 6 But someone will say to him, 'What are these wounds between your arms?' and he will answer, 'I was wounded with those in my friends' house.'"
