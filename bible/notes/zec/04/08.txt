\v 8 Then Yahweh gave me \add another\add* message.
\v 9 He said to me, "Zerubbabel \f + \ft synecdoche \f* laid the first stone in the foundation of the temple, and he will put the last stone in its place. When that happens, the people will know that it is I, the Almighty Commander of the armies of angels, who have sent you to them.
\p
\v 10 No one \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* should think that little things that are done at the beginning of a big project are unimportant. \add When the temple is almost finished being rebuilt\add*, Zerubbabel will use a plumb line\f + \ft Or: string with a stone fastened to it \f* \add to see if the walls they are building are straight\add*, so when the people see that, they will rejoice."
\p
\v 11 Then I asked the angel, "What is the meaning of the two olive trees, one on each side of the lampstand?

<usfm>
\v 8 (11) Then I asked the angel, "What is the meaning of the two olive trees, one on each side of the lampstand?
\v 9 (12) And what is the meaning of the two olive branches, one alongside each of the gold pipes from which olive oil flows to the lamps?"
\p
\v 10 (13) He replied, "Surely you know what they are."
\p I replied, "No, sir, I do not know."
\p
\v 11 (14) So he said, "They represent the two men whom the Lord who rules the whole earth has appointed."

\v 8 (11) I answered and said to him, "What are these two olive trees to the right and left sides of the lampstand?"
\v 9 (12) Then I spoke again and said to him, "What are these two olive branches that are beside the two golden pipes that pour out oil from themselves?"
\v 10 (13) He continued and spoke to me, "Don't you know what these are?" And I said, "No, my lord."
\v 11 (14) He said, "These are the two sons of oil who stand beside the Lord of the whole earth."
