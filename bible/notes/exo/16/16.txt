\v 16 This is the command that Yahweh has given: 'You must gather, each one of you, the amount you need to eat, an omer for each person of the number of your people. This is how you will gather it: Gather enough to eat for every person who lives in your tent.'"
\v 17 The people of Israel did so. Some gathered more, some gathered less.
\v 18 When they measured it with an omer measure, those who had gathered much had nothing over, and those who had gathered little had no lack. Each person gathered enough to meet their need.
