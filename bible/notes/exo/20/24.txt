\v 24 You must make an earthen altar for me, and you must sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, fellowship offerings, sheep, and oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be honored, I will come to you and bless you.
\v 25 If you make me an altar of stone, you must not build it of cut stones, for if you use your tools on it, you will have defiled it.
\v 26 You must not go up by steps to my altar; this is to keep you from exposing your private parts.
