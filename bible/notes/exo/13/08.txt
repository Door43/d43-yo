\v 8 On that day you are to say to your children, 'This is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came  out of Egypt.'
\v 9 This rescue will become reminders for you on your hands, and reminders on your forehead. This is so that Yahweh's Law may be in your speech, for it was with a strong hand that Yahweh brought you out of Egypt.
\v 10 Therefore you must keep this law at this time every year.
