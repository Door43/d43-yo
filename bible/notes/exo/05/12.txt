  * **stubble for straw** - the part of the plant not taken for harvest
  * **Why have you not produced all the bricks required of you ...?** - These remarks are put into the form of a question to make the scolding of the slave bosses sound even more harsh. (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
