===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Lord why have you caused trouble for this people?** - By putting these remarks in the form of questions, the writer softens the criticism that Moses has for Yahweh. AT: "You should not have brought this trouble upon the people!"; (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **Why did you send me in the first place?** - AT: "You should never have sent me here!"; (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **to speak to him in your name** - AT: "to give him your message"; (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
