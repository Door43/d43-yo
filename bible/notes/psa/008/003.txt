<usfm>
\q
\v 3 When I look up at your heavens, which your fingers have made,
\q the moon and the stars, which you have set in place;
\q
\v 4 Of what importance is the human race, that you notice them,
\q or mankind , that you pay attention to  them?
\q
\v 5 Yet you have made them but a little lower than the heavenly beings,
\q and crown them with glory and honor.
