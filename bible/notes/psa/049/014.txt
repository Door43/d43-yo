\q
\v 14 They are appointed, like a flock, to go to Sheol;
\q death will be their shepherd;
\q the upright will have power over them in the morning;
\q and their beauty will be for Sheol to consume,
\q that there be no habitation for it.

\v 15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of Sheol;
\q for he will receive me.
