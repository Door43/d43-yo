<usfm>
\q
\v 6 Break their teeth in their mouth, God;
\q break out the great teeth of the young lions, Yahweh.
\q
\v 7 Let them melt away as water that runs off;
\q when you aims your arrows, let them be as though they were cut off.
\q
\v 8 Let them be like a snail that melts and passes away,
\q like the untimely birth of a woman that never sees the sunlight.
</usfm>
