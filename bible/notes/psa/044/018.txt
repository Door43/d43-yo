\v 22 But it is because we belong to you,
\q2 \add that our enemies\add* are constantly killing us.

<usfm>
\q
\v 18 Our heart has not turned back,
\q neither have our steps gone from your way,
\q
\v 19 That you should have severely broken us in the place of jackals
\q and covered us with the shadow of death.
\q
\v 20 If we have forgotten the name of our God
\q or spread out our hands to a strange god,
\q
\v 21 Would not God search this out?
\q For he knows the secrets of the heart.
\q
\v 22 Indeed, for your sake we are being killed all day long;
\q we are considered to be sheep for the slaughter.
