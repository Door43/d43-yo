<usfm>
\v 5 It is all right if righteous people strike me or rebuke me
\q2 because they are trying to act kindly toward me to teach me to do what is right;
\q1 if they do that, it will be as if someone honored me by anointing my head with olive oil;
\q2 but I am always praying that you will punish the wicked because of the wicked deeds that they do.
\b
\q1
\v 6 When their rulers are thrown down from the top of rocky cliffs,
\q2 but they will know that what I am saying here is good.
\q1
\v 7 They will know one day that their bodies will lie scattered on the ground in the place of the dead,
\q2 just like one scatters clods of earth when he plows a field.
\b

\q
\v 5 Let righteous man hit me; it will be a kindness to me;
\q let him correct me; it will be like oil on my ;
\q  But my prayer is always against the deeds of the wicked people.
\q
\v 6 Their leaders will be thrown down from the top of cliffs;
\q they will hear that  my own words are pleasant.
\q
\v 7 They will have to say, "As when one plows and breaks up the ground,
\q so our bones have been scattered at the mouth of Sheol."
