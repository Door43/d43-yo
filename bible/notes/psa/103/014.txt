\v 14 He knows what our bodies are like;
\q2 he remembers that he created us from dust,
\q2 and that we therefore quickly fail to do what pleases him .
\q1
\v 15 We humans do not live forever;
\q2 we are like grass, which withers and dies.
\q1 We are like wild flowers: They bloom for a short while,
\q1
\v 16 but then the hot wind blows over them, and they disappear;
\q2 no one sees them again.

<usfm>
\q
\v 14 For he knows how we are formed;
\q he knows that we are dust.
\q
\v 15 As for man, his days are like grass;
\q he flourishes like a flower in a field.
\q
\v 16 For the wind blows over it, and it disappears,
\q and no one can even tell where it once grew.
