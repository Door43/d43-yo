\v 4 Don't they know, those who commit iniquity,
\q those who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q but do not call on God?

\v 5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was;
\q for God has scattered the bones of him who encamps against you;
\q you have put them to shame because God has rejected them.
