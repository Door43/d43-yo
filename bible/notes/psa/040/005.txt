\v 5 O Yahweh, my God, you have done many wonderful things!

\q2 because there would be too many for me to mention.
\b

\q2 are not all that you require \add for sins to be forgiven\add*.

<usfm>
\q
\v 5 Many, Yahweh my God, are the wonderful deeds that you have done,
\q and your thoughts which are about us;
\q they cannot be numbered;
\q if I declared and spoke of them,
\q they would be more than could be counted.
\q
\v 6 You have no delight in sacrifice or offering;
\q but you have opened my ears;
\q you have not required burnt offerings or sin offerings.
</usfm>
