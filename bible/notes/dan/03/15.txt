\v 15 Now if you are ready—when you hear the sounds of the horns, flutes, zithers, lyres, harps, and pipes, and all kinds of music—to fall down and prostrate yourselves to the statue thatI have made, all will be well. But if you do not worship, you will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. Who is the god able to rescue you out of my hands?"
