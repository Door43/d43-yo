\v 5 As I was thinking about this, I saw a male goat come from the west, across the face of the whole earth, running fast, not seeming to touch the ground. The goat had a large horn between his eyes.
\v 6 He came to the ram who had two horns—I had seen the ram standing on the bank of the canal—and the goat ran toward the ram in a powerful rage.
