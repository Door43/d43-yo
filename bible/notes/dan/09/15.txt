\v 16 But now, because you do what is  righteous, we request you to not be angry with Jerusalem any longer, O Lord. Jerusalem is your city, and your temple was built there on your sacred hill.

<usfm>
\v 15 Now, Lord our God, you brought out your people from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and you have made a famous name for yourself, as in this present day. But still we sinned; we have done wicked things.
\v 16 Lord, because of all your righteousness, let your anger and your wrath turn away from your city Jerusalem, the mountain of your holiness. Because of our sins, and because of the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an object of scorn to all those around us.
