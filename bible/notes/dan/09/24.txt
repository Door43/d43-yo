\v 24 Seventy sevens of years, i.e., 490 years are decreed for your people and your holy city to finish the transgression and put an end to sin, to atone for wickedness, to bring everlasting righteousness, to carry out the vision and the prophecy, and to consecrate the most holy place.
\v 25 Know and understand that from the issuing of the order to restore and rebuild Jerusalem to the coming of the anointed one (who will be a leader), will be seven sevens, i.e., forty-nine years, and sixty-two sevens, i.e., 434 years. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and a moat, despite the times of distress.
