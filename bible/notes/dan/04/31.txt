\v 32 Your advisors will force you to live away from other people. You will live in the fields with wild animals, and you will eat grass like cows do. You will live that way for seven years, until you learn that it is I, the Supreme God, who rules over the kingdoms of this world, and I appoint the ones whom I have chosen to rule them."

\v 31 While the king was still saying this, a voice came from heaven: "King Nebuchadnezzar, it has been decreed against you that this kingdom no longer belongs to you.
\v 32 You will be driven away from people, and your home will be with the wild animals in the fields. You will be made to eat grass like an ox. Seven years will pass until you acknowledge that the most high God rules over the kingdoms of people and he gives them to anyone he wishes."
