====== Daniel 02:41-43 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 41 The feet and toes of the statue that you saw, that were a mixture of iron and clay, indicate that the kingdom they represent will later be divided.
\v 42 Some parts of that kingdom will be as strong as iron, but some parts will not remain together, just as iron an clay do not stay together.
\v 43 The mixture of iron and clay \add in the statue\add* shows also that the rulers of those kingdoms that separate from each other will try to form alliances with each other as a result of members of the royal families of these kingdoms marrying each other. But that will not succeed, just as iron and clay do not stick together.

\v 42 Some parts of that kingdom will be as strong as iron, but some parts will not remain together, just as iron an clay do not stay together when mixed.

\v 41 Just as you, saw the feet and toes were partly made of baked clay and partly made of iron, so it will be a divided kingdom; some of the strength of iron will be in it, just as you saw iron mixed with the soft clay.
\v 42 As the toes of the feet were partly made of iron and partly made of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong and partly brittle.
\v 43 As you saw the iron mixed with soft clay, so the people will be a mixture and they will not hold together, just as iron does not mix with clay.
