\v 29 As for you, king, your thoughts on your bed were about things to come, and the Revealer of Mysteries has made known to you what is about to happen.
\v 30 As for me, this secret was not revealed to me because of any wisdom that I have more than any other living person. This secret was revealed to me so that you, king, may understand the meaning, and so that you may know the thoughts deep within you.
