\v 10 The men who studied the stars replied to the king, "There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his men who work magic or his fortune-tellers or men who study the stars to do something like that!
\v 11 What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!"

\v 10 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man upon the earth that can show the kingâ€™s matter,
forasmuch as no king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.
\v 11 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is no other that can show it before the king, except the gods,
whose dwelling is not with flesh.
