\v 7 But again they replied, "Tell us what you dreamed, and then we will tell you what it means."

\v 8 The king replied, "I know that you are just trying to get more time, because you know that I will do to you what I said that I would do.
\v 9 If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you will be punished. \add I think\add* that you have all agreed to tell me lies and other wicked things, because you hope that I will change \add my mind\f + \ft Or: what I am thinking\add* \f*. But tell me the dream, and then I will know that you can also tell me what it means."

\v 10 The men who studied the stars replied to the king, "There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his men who work magic or his fortune-tellers or men who study the stars to do something like that!
\v 11 What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!"

\v 8 The king replied, "I know that you are just trying to get more time because you know that I will do to you what I said that I would do.
\v 9 If you do not tell me what I dreamed, you know what I promised to do to you. I think that you have all agreed to tell me lies and other wicked things before your time is up. So then, you have only one choice. Tell me the dream, and I will know you can tell me what it means."

\v 10 The wise men replied to the king, "There is no one on the earth who can do what you ask! There is no king, even a great and mighty king, who has ever asked his astrologers or those who claim to speak with the dead, or wise men like ourselves to do something like that!
\v 11 What you are asking us to do is impossible. Only the gods can tell you what you dreamed, and they do not live among us!"

\v 7 They replied again and said, "Let the king tell us, his servants, the dream and we will tell you its meaning."
\v 8 The king answered, "I know for certain that you want more time because you see how firm my decision is about this.
\v 9 But if you do not tell me the dream, there is only one sentence for you. You have decided to prepare false and deceptive words that you agreed together to say to me until I change my mind. So then, tell me the dream, and then I will know you can interpret it for me."
\v 10 The wise men replied to the king, "There is not a man on earth able to meet the kingâ€™s demand. There is no great and powerful king who has demanded such a thing from any magician, or from anyone who claims to speak with the dead, or from a wise man.
\v 11 What the king demands is difficult, and there is no one who can tell it to the king except the gods, and they do not live among humans."
