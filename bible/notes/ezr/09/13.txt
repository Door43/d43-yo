\v 13 You punished us because we were very guilty for having done wicked things. But you have not punished us as much as we deserve to be punished. \add I say this because\add* you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive.
\v 14 However, some of us are again disobeying your commands, and we are marrying women who do those detestable things. If we continue to do that, surely you will get rid of all of us \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*, with the result that none of us will remain alive.

\v 13 Yet after everything that came on us for our evil practices and our great guilt—since you, our God, have held back what our iniquities deserve and left us survivors—
\v 14 should we again break your commandments and make mixed marriages with these abominable people? Will you not be angry and annihilate us so there will be no one left, no one to escape?
