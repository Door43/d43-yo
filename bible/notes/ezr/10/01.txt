\v 1 As Ezra prayed and confessed, he wept and threw himself down before God's house. A very great assembly of Israelite men, women, and children 
gathered to him, for the people were weeping very greatly.
\v 2 Shekaniah son of Jehiel of the descendants of Elam said to Ezra, â€œWe ourselves have committed treason against our God and have lived with foreign 
women from the people of the other lands. But now there is hope for Israel concerning this.
