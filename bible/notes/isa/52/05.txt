\q1 My people are being forced to be slaves again, this time by the people of Babylonia.

\q2 when that happens, they will know that I am the one who said that this would happen.
\q1 It is I, Yahweh, who will do it."

  * **Those who rule over them wail** - Yahweh's people wail because of the way their captors treat them.
  * **and my name is slandered continually all the day.** - The people groups who witness the capture of Yahweh's people believe that Yahweh cannot protect his own people, so these people groups slander Yahweh.  (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
