  * **as a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and as a sheep that before its shearers is silent** - God's servant is being compared to a lamb led to be killed and a sheep that is going to have the wool shaved off his body. "He did not say anything to defend himself when he was tortured and killed" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
