===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Therefore will I give him his portion among the multitudes, and he will divide the spoils with the many** - Here "his portion" describes what God will give his servant that he is to share with all the people, just as a King divides "the spoils" among his soldiers after a victorious battle. The words "portion" and "spoils" basically mean the same thing.
  * **He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressions** - The word "intercession" means to do something on behalf of another. AT: "On behalf of all people, he bore their sins."
