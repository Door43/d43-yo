===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **they are not silent day or night** - By using this negative statement, Yahweh is expressing that the opposite is actually true. The Watchmen will pray earnestly to Yahweh day and night. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]])
    * **Do not allow him to rest until he reestablishes Jerusalem** - Here "him" refers to Yahweh.
