===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **for my salvation is near, and my vindication is about to be revealed.** - This is saying the same thing in two different ways for emphasis. AT: "I will soon come to rescue you." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
  * **and keeps his hand from doing any evil** - Since it is with hands that evil things are done, "hand'" is used here as a shorter way of referring to people who do evil things. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
