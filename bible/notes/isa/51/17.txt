===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Awake, awake, stand up, Jerusalem** - Yahweh made this exclamation to the people of Jerusalem as though they can hear him. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_apostrophe]])
    * **you who drank from the hand of Yahweh the cup of his anger** - The "hand of Yahweh" refers to their severe punishment by Yahweh. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **you drank the bowl,  the cup of staggering, and you drained it** - The "cup of staggering" is referred to their "suffering." This is comparing their suffering to someone who causes another person to suffer by forcing him to drink every drop of a cupful of bitter liquid. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
