===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:yo:obe:kt:righteous]]
  * [[:yo:obe:kt:yahweh]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **look at the rock from which you were chiseled** - Here Abraham is compared to a "rock." A rock is a solid foundation. Yahweh is asking them to think about Abraham who was like a huge rock cliff, a solid foundation of the nation of Israel. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **and to the quarry from which you were cut** - Here Yahweh is comparing the forming of Israel into a nation to stones cut from a rocky cliff. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
