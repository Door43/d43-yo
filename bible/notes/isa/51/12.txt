===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Why are you afraid of men ... made like grass?** - This is a rhetorical question meant to emphasize that they should not be afraid of humans. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **who are made like grass** - This is comparing humans to grass that withers and dies. So humans too will eventually die. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
