\q1

===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:yo:obe:other:ruler]]
  * [[:yo:obe:other:earth]]
  * [[:yo:obe:other:sow]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **He reduces** - "God reduces"
  * **they are barely plantedâ€¦they have barely taken root in the earth** - Isaiah compares the rulers to a seed that is not planted firmly in the ground. This emphasizes they are insignificant before God. (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **the wind blows them away like straw** - This emphasizes that God can easily defeat human rulers. (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
