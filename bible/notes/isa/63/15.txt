===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **Where are your zeal and your mighty acts?** - This rhetorical question is meant to express deep emotion and perhaps deep concern or regret. Yahweh, who previously was very concerned about them and acted powerfully to help them is no longer merciful to them. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
