    * **Yahweh, why do you make us wander from your ways and harden our hearts, so we do not obey you?** - This rhetorical question expresses deep regret by the Israelites. They are wondering why Yahweh allowed them to wander away from him and why did he cause them to be stubborn and disobedient. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
