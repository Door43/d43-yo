===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **like those who were never called by your name** - Here "name" represents the family of Yahweh. The Israelites are deeply saddened that they feel like they never belonged to Yahweh, even though they did belong to Yahweh in the past. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
