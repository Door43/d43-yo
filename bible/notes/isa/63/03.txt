===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I have trod grapes in the winepress alone** - Yahweh has not been treading on grapes. AT: "I have been treading on my enemies, not on grapes." (UDB) 
    * **For I looked forward to the day of vengeance** - "Day" here actually represents "time" or a "period of time."  Yahweh says it was time for him to take his revenge on their enemies. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_synecdoche]])
