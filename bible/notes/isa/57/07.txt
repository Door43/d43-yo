    * **Upon a high mountain you prepared your bed** - This is a polite way for saying that they had sex with the idols' prostitutes on the mountains. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
    * **made yourselves bare, and went up; you made your bed wide** - This is also a gentler way of saying that they had taken off their clothes and got into their bed and invited many of their lovers to join them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_euphemism]])
