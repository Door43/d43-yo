===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **and I will make you ride on the high places of the earth** - Here Yahweh is making a comparison. If they keep all his commands, then he will highly honor them and it will be as though they are riding with him in the high mountains. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **for the mouth of Yaweh has spoken** - Here "mouth" is a shorter way for saying that Yahweh has spoken, because it is with the mouth that one speaks. AT: "Because I, yahweh have said it." (UDB) (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
