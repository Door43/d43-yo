===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **If you turn back from the Sabbath day your feet from doing your own pleasure on my holy day** - Here "feet" are used as a shorter form for "travel", since it is with ones feet that people travel long distances. Yahweh tells them not to travel far on the day of rest and to not only do the things that please them. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
