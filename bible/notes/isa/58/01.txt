===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **lift up your voice like a trumpet** - Here Yahweh is commanding the prophet to be bold and shout loudly to the people about their sin just as loud as a trumpet is when it is blown. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
  * **confront my people with their rebellion, and the house of Jacob with their sins** - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. Yahweh wants to warn his people, the Israelites of their sins. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
