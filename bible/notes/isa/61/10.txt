\q1
\v 10 I will greatly rejoice in Yahweh; my soul will exult in my God. 
\q1 For he has clothed me with the garments of
salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness, 
\q1 as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.
\q1
\v 11 For like the earth produces its sprouting plants, and like the garden makes its planting grow,
\q1 so the Lord Yahweh will cause righteousness and praise to sprout up in front of all the nations.

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **For he has clothed me with the garments of salvation; he has clothed me with the robe of righteousness** - This is comparing salvation and righteousness to garments and robes. Just like garments and robes are put on to cover one's shame and instead look good, Yahweh has covered his Servant with his blessings. Yahweh has saved him and declared him righteous. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
    * **as a bridegroom adorns himself with a turban, and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels** - Just like the bridegroom is happy in his wedding clothes, and the bride in her jewels, the servant is also extremely happy. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]])
    * **For like the earth puts forth its sprouting plants, and like the garden makes its planting grow** - This is saying the same thing in two ways for emphasis. It can be translated as, "Just as seeds sown in a garden sprout from the soil and grow." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
