===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Ho** - This word is used to get their attention. AT: "Listen to me."
  * **all who thirst, come to the water** - Here Yahweh's blessing is compared to the power of water to refresh or renew a person. Yahweh's promise to save provides satisfaction for all the exiles. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
