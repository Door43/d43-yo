\v 1 This is also what Yahweh says:
\q1 "You \add Israelite children\add*, do not think \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* that I \add forced your parents to be exiled\f + \ft Or: taken \f* to Babylonia\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f*
\q2 like some men send away their wives
\q1 after giving them a paper

\q1 I certainly did not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* get rid of you like a man who sells his children to get money to pay what he owes.
\q1 No, the reason that I forced you to be exiled

  * [[:yo:obe:kt:yahweh]]
  * [[:yo:obe:other:divorce]]
  * [[:yo:obe:kt:sin]]
  * [[:yo:obe:other:rebel]]

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Where is the certificate of divorce with which I divorced your mother?** - Here Yahweh is comparing his commitment to his people with a rhetorical question that asks where the divorce papers are, implying he did not force his people to be exiled to Babylon like a man send his wife away. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **And to which of my creditors did I sell you?** - Yahweh uses this rhetorical question and compares his steadfast love for his people unlike a debtor who sells his children to get money to pay off his creditors. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]]  and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **you were sold because of your sins, and because of your rebellion** - This is saying the same thing in two different ways for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
