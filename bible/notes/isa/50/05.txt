===== Important Terms: =====

  * [[:yo:obe:kt:lordyahweh]]
  * [[:yo:obe:other:shame]]
 

===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **and I was not rebellious, nor did I turn away backward** - By using Litotes, the Servant emphasizes that he has not rejected but accepted what Yahweh has said to him. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes]]) 
    * **I did not hide my face from acts of shame and spitting** - "Face" represents the person. Here the Servant uses the word face as a shorter way of referring to himself. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
