===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **They all gather themselves together and come to you** - "They" refers to the people who are returning from their exile.
    * **Then you will look and be radiant, and your heart shall rejoice and overflow** - This is saying the same thing in two different ways for emphasis. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]])
