\v 9 I am praying for you, that you might love each other more and more, and that you might know and understand why God wants you to do so.
\v 10 I also pray that God will enable you to know what you should believe and the best ways in which you should act. I pray for this, so that you might be honest and blameless at the time when Christ returns.
\v 11 I also pray that you will always do the things that you can do because God has declared you good in his sight because of Jesus Christ. Then other people will see how you honor God.

  * **the things that are excellent**  - "what is most pleasing to God"
  * **you may be sincere and without offense in the day of Christ.**  - The phrase "sincere and without offense" is a doublet that emphasizes a person's moral purity. This may be translated as "you are completely blameless when Jesus returns." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet|Doublet]])
