\q
\v 1 Woe is me!
\q For me it is like when the harvest of summer fruit is over,
\q and also even the gleaning of the left-over grapes in the vineyards:
\q There are no more clusters of fruit to be found,
\q but I still crave first ripe figs.
\q
\v 2 The godly man has perished from the earth;
\q there is no one left who is upright among the people.
\q They all lie in wait to shed others' blood;
\q everyone and his brother hunt someone with a net.
