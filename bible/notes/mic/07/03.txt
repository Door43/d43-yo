\q
\v 3 Their hands are very good at doing harm:
\q the ruler asks for money,
\q the judge is ready for bribes,
\q and the powerful man is saying to other what he wants to obtain.
\q Thus they plot together.
\q
\v 4 The best of them is like briers,
\q the most upright is a hedge of thorns.
\q It is the day foretold by your watchmen,
\q the day of your punishment.
\q Now their confusion has arrived.
