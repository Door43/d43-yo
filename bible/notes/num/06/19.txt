===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 19 The meat from the ram's shoulder must be boiled. After it is cooked, the priest will take it along with one of the loaves of bread and one wafer which has been brushed with \add olive\add* oil, and he will put them in your hands.
\v 20 Then the priest will \add take them back\add* and lift them up high to dedicate them to me. They now belong to the priest, and he is permitted to eat some of the meat from the ram's shoulder and from its ribs and from one of its thighs, because that meat is his share of the sacrifice. After that, you will no longer be a Nazir-man, and you will again be permitted to drink wine.

\v 19 The priest must take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one loaf of bread without yeast out of the basket, and one wafer without yeast. He must place them into the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his head indicating  separation.
\v 20 The priest must raise them high as an offering before Yahweh and present them to him. This is holy food, reserved for the priest, together with the breast that was raised and thigh that was raised. After that the Nazirite may drink wine.
