\v 8 Again, Moses said to Korah, "Now listen, you descendants of Levi:
\v 9 is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the community ofIsrael, to bring you near to himself, to do work in Yahwehâ€™s tabernacle, and to stand before the community to serve them?
\v 10 He has brought you near, and all your kinfolk, the descendants of Levi, with you, yet you are seeking the priesthood also!
\v 11 That is why you and all your group have gathered together against Yahweh. So why are you complaining about Aaron, who obeys Yahweh?"
