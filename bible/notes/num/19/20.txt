====== Numbers 19:20-22 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 20 If those who have become unacceptable to me do not become acceptable to me again by doing this, they will no longer belong to the Israelite people, because they have defiled my Sacred Tent. They did not sprinkle on themselves the water that removes the guilt of their sins, so they remain unacceptable to me.
\v 21 That is a law for the Israelite people that will never be changed. Those who sprinkle that water on themselves must then wash their clothes. And anyone who touches that water which removes guilt for sins will remain unacceptable to God until that evening.
\p
\v 22 Anything and any person whom someone who has become unacceptable to me has touched will remain unacceptable to me until that evening."

\p
\v 20 But anyone who remains unclean, who refuses to purify himself—that person will be cut off from the community, because he has defiled Yahweh’s sanctuary. The water for impurity has not been sprinkled on him; he remains  unclean.
\v 21 This will be an ongoing law concerning these situations. The one who sprinkles the water for impurity must wash his clothes. The one who touches the water for impurity will become unclean until evening.
\v 22 Whatever the unclean person touches will become unclean. The person who touches it will become unclean until evening.”
