\v 20 So Moses replied to them, â€œIf you do what you say, if you arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to war,
\v 21 then every one of your armed men must cross over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him
\v 22 and the land is subdued before him. Then afterward you may return. You will be guiltless towards Yahweh and towards Israel. This land will be your possession before Yahweh.
