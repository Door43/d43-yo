\v 13 But any person who is clean and is not on a journey, but who fails to keep the Passover, that person must be cut off from his people because he did not offer the sacrifice that Yahweh requires at the fixed time of year.That man must carry his sin.
\v 14 If a stranger lives among you and keeps the Passover in Yahweh’s honor, he must keep it and do all he  commands, keeping the rules of the Passover, and obeying the laws for it. You must have the same  law for the foreigner and for all who have been born in the land.”
