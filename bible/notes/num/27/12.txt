\v 12 One day, Yahweh said to Moses\f + \ft Or: me \f*, "Climb to the top of the Abarim mountains \add east of the Jordan River\add*. Then look out over the land that I am giving to the Israelite people.
\v 13 After you have seen it, you will die \f + \ft euphemism \f* just like your \add older\add* brother Aaron did.
\v 14 The reason \add that you will die and not enter that land\add* is that you both disobeyed my instructions\f + \ft Or: commands \f* in the Zin Desert. When the Israelite people rebelled against me there at Meribah, near Kadesh, \add I told you to speak to the rock to cause\add* water to flow out of it. \add But because you struck the rock instead of speaking to it\add*, you did not show the people my holy power."

\v 12 Yahweh said to Moses, "Go up the mountains of Abarim and look at the land that I have given to the people of Israel.
\v 13 After you have seen it, you, too, must be gathered to your people, like Aaron your brother. 
\v 14 This will happen because you two rebelled against my command in the wilderness of Zin. There, when the water flowed from the rock, in your anger you failed to honor me as holy before the eyes of the whole community." These are the Waters of Meribah of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
