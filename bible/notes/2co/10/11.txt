====== 2 Corinthians 10:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 The \add people who say\add* such things should think carefully about this: The kind of \add severe\add* person that \add you think\add* me to be when you read my letters is exactly the kind of person I will be when I come. \add I will do what I wrote that I would do\add*.
\p
\v 12 \add Those who oppose me\add* tell others how good they are. \add If they really were superior to me\add* \f + \ft irony \f*, I would not be so bold as to say that I \add was equal to them, or\add* to compare myself with them\add . But they are not superior to me\add*. They make up their own standards \add about what God's servants should be like\add*, and then they look at their own \add conduct\add* and decide \add whether or not they meet those standards. By doing that, they show that\add* they are foolish.

\v 11 Let those who criticize me know that what we write to you in our letters are the very things we do when we are with you.
\p
\v 12 We will not even try to compare ourselves with those who praise themselves. When they compare themselves to one another, it proves only that they are foolish.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Let such people understand that what we say by letter when we are away, is the same we as will do when we are there.
\v 12 We do not go so far as to classify or compare ourselves with those who praise themselves. But when they measure themselves by one other and compare themselves with each other, they have no insight.
