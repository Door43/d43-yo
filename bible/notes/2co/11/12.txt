\v 12 There are \add some men there among you\add* who would like to be able to say boastfully that they \add work among you\add* just as I do.

\v 13 Those men are lying \add when they say that they are\add* apostles. They work deceitfully. \add Even though they say that they work for God, they are working only for themselves\add*. They try to make people think that Christ \add sent them\add* as his apostles, \add but they do not truly represent him\add*.
