====== 2 Corinthians 12:11-13 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 It has been foolish for me \add to talk about myself like this\add*, but it is you who forced me to do it. Truly \add if the Lord would not help me\add*, I would be worthless, \add as my opponents say that I am\add*. But none of the men whom you \add wrongfully think\add* \f + \ft irony \f* are great apostles are greater in any way than I am. So it would have been right\f + \ft Or: proper \f* for you to say good things about me.
\v 12 \add You should have done that, because\add* when I was with you \add I\add* repeatedly did the things that showed you that \add I am truly\add* an apostle, such as performing many \f + \ft doublet \f* miracles.
\v 13 And I have \add certainly treated\add* you as well as \add I treated\add* the other congregations \add that I helped to start. Or do you think that\add* by not asking you \add to pay me for my work\add*, I was not treating you as well as I treated the other congregations? It is foolish for you to\add think that\add* \f + \ft irony \f* \add it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that!\f + \ft Or: Do you \add think that it\add* was wrong for me not \add to ask for pay from you for my work, and therefore I should ask\add* you to forgive me for that? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 11 When I write this way, I am praising myself. But I had to do so, because you should have had confidence in me. I am just as good as these "super-apostles," even though I am really nothing at all.
\v 12 I gave you the true signs of being an authentic apostle—miracles that I did very patiently among you: wonderful miracles that proved that I truly serve Jesus Christ.
\v 13 You certainly were just as important as all the other churches! The only way you were different was that I received no money from you as I did from them. Forgive me that I did not ask this from you!

\p
\v 11 I have become a fool! You forced me to be, for I should have been praised by you, for I was not at all inferior to the "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.
\v 12 The true signs of an apostle were performed among you with all patience—signs and wonders and mighty deeds.
\v 13 For how were you less important than the rest of the churches, except that I was not a burden to you? Forgive me this wrong!
