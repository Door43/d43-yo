====== 2 Corinthians 12:8-10 ======

<usfm>
\v 8 Three times I prayed to the Lord about it, begging him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "\add No, I will not take this away from you. Instead\add*, I will kindly help you, and that will be all that you need, because it is \add when you are\add* weak that I \add can\add* best \add work\add* powerfully \add to help you\add*." So, because of \add what the Lord said to me\add*, I will very gladly boast about \add the things that make\add* me \add seem\add* weak, so that \add people may realize\add* that it is Christ who gives me power \add to serve him\add*.
\v 10 For that reason, \add whenever I am\add* weak, or \add when people\add* insult me, \add or when I have to endure\add* hardships, or \add when I am persecuted\add* \f + \ft Or:\add people\add* cause me to suffer \f* or \add when I am in situations that\add* distress me, I am content because \add I am serving\add* Christ. \add I can say that\add* because at any time when I myself am weak, that is the \add very\add* time when \add Christ\add* powerfully \add helps me\add*.

\v 8 I prayed three times to the Lord about this matter;  each time I begged him to take this away from me.
\v 9 But he said to me, "No, I will not take this away from you. All you need is for me to love you and be wtih you, because I do my most powerful work in you when you are weak." That is why I would rather be proud of my weakness, so that Christ's power can come and make me strong.
\v 10 I can face anything because Christ is with me. It may be that I must be weak, or that others might treat me with scorn, or that I must have great hardships, or that others will try to kill me. It may be that I will continue to suffer hardships of various kinds. In any case, when my power is gone, then I am at my strongest.

\v 8 Three times I begged the Lord about this, that he might take it from me.
\v 9 And he said to me, "My grace is enough for you, for power is made perfect in weakness." So I would much rather boast about my weakness, so that the power of Christ might rest on me.
\v 10 Therefore I am content for Christâ€™s sake, in weaknesses, in insults, in troubles, in persecutions, in distresses, for whenever I am weak, then I am strong.
