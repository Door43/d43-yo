====== 2 Corinthians 12:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 But even if I should choose to boast \add to you about such wonderful things that happened to me\add*, I would not be \add speaking like\add* a fool, because I would be telling you the truth. But I will not \add talk proudly about such things\add*, because I do not want any of you to think highly of me \add because of the things that have happened to me\add*. Instead, \add I want you to decide what kind of person I am by the way you see\add* me \add acting\add* and by what you hear me teach.
\v 7 In order that I might not become proud because of those many wonderful things \add that Christ\add* revealed to me, \add God permitted\add* Satan to send a messenger \add to humble me\add* \f + \ft Or: to \add make me sick\add* \f*. \add What he did to me was painful, like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* a thorn pricking my body.

\v 6 Even if I kept on boasting about myself, I would not be foolish, because I would be saying only what was true. However, I will boast no more, so that you can judge me only by what you hear me say, or by what you already know about me.
\v 7 So I will leave the subject of the amazing visions that God gave me; except that I should tell you that God sent me something very difficult to bear, a device from Satan, in order to cause me to suffer. God did this so that I would not become proud about the visions I saw.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 If I wanted to boast, I would not be foolish, for I would be speaking the truth; but I will keep from boasting, so that no one may think more of me than what is seen in me or heard from me,
\v 7 or because of the extraordinary nature of the revelations. Therefore, so I would not be puffed up with pride, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger from Satan to harass me, so I would not become overly proud.
