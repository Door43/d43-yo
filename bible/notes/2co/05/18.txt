\v 19 The message of that brings God and people together, is how God made peace with the world by what Christ did. God did not applying their sins to their account. And now, Christ has taken our sins away and has given us this message that makes peace and brings God and people together.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **who reconciled us**  - AT: "who brought us back". "us" refers to Paul and Timothy." __According to the context and especially verse 17, I think "us" refers to Christians in general. __
  * **ministry of reconciliation**  - AT: "ministry of leading people from a mutinous (or "rebellious") attitude to a saving relationship with Christ." __"leading people into harmony (or unity)  with each other." __
  * **in Christ God is reconciling the world to himself, **- AT: "through Christ's sacrificial death on the cross, God is erasing the barrier that is caused by sin between the world and himself,"__seems wordy.  Omit "sacrificial" __
  * **entrusting to us the message of reconciliation**  - AT: "giving us the responsibility to spread this message of peace" __"giving us the responsibiity to spread the message of making us one with him." __
