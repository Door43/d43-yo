===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 1 We know that these bodies are only temporary dwelling places, like tents that don't last very long. But we know that when we die, God gives us a permanent place in which we will live, a body that lasts forever, a body that God has made.
\v 2 While we live in our physical bodies, we groan with longing for the bodies will have when we will live with God—
\v 3 because when God clothes us in our new bodies, that will be our covering, like clothing.

\p
\v 1 We know that if the earthly dwelling that we live in is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven.
\v 2 For in this tent we groan, longing to be clothed with our heavenly dwelling—
\v 3 because by putting it on we will not be found naked.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **dwelling/building/house/tent**  - These words all refer to our physical body in v1-3.
  * **the earthly dwelling **  - "our body" - (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]])
  * **live in is destroyed **- AT: "live in dies"
  * **we have a building from God, a house not made by human hands, but an eternal house, in heaven. **- (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]]) AT: "God has new body waiting for us when he resurrects Christians from the grave. This new body will never die."
  * **For in this tent we groan**- AT: "For in this earthly body we struggle" - (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor|Metaphor]]) Our physical bodies here on earth hinder our desire to be righteous because they are affected by sin; however, sin will not affect our new heavenly body.
  * **because by putting it on we will not be found naked.**  - AT: "we will be clothed in God's righteousness." or "because God will provide clothing for our new bodies."
