\v 4 This plan appeared to be right in the eyes of the king and of all the assembly.
\v 5 So they established a decree to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba to Dan, that the people should come to celebrate the Passover of Yahweh, the God of Israel, at Jerusalem. Indeed, they had not kept it in the great numbers that it had been commanded in writing.
