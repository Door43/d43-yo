\v 13 Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear loyalty to him by God. But Zedekiah stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 14 Moreover, all the leaders of the priests, and the people, trespassed very much, following the disgusting things of the other peoples. They polluted the house of Yahweh, which he had consecrated in Jerusalem.
