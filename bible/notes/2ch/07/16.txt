===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 16 I have chosen and have set apart\f + \ft Or: dedicated \f* this temple in order that people may worship \f + \ft metonymy \f* me there forever. I will always watch over \f + \ft metonymy \f* it and protect [IDI] it.
\pi
\v 17 And as for you, if you obey me as David your father did, and if you do all that I command you to do, and obey all my laws and decrees,
\v 18 I will make sure that your descendants will always be kings, which is what I promised to David your father, saying 'Ones from your descendants will always be the kings of Israel.'
\pi
\v 19 But if you Israelites turn away from me and disobey the decrees and commands that I have given to you, and you start to worship other gods,
\v 20 I will cause you to be expelled from this land that I have given to you, and I will reject\f + \ft Or: abandon \f* this temple that I have set apart to be the place where people should worship \f + \ft metonymy \f* me. I will cause it to be despised and ridiculed by people of all nations.

<usfm>
\v 16 I have decided to be present in this temple, and I have set apart it for myself. I will protect it for all time.
\pi
\v 17 And as for you, if you obey me as David, your father, did, and if you do all that I command you to do, and if you obey all my laws and decrees,
\v 18 I will make sure that your descendants will always be kings, which is what I promised to David your father, when I told him, 'Persons from your descendants will always be the kings of Israel.'


\pi
\v 19 But if you Israelites turn away from me and disobey the decrees and commands that I have given to you, and you start to worship other gods,
\v 20 I will cause you to be driven away from this land that I have given to you, and I will reject the temple that I have set apart for myself. I will make people from all the other people groups laugh about what happened to it.

\v 16 For I have now chosen and consecrated this house, so that my name may be there forever; and my eyes and my heart will be there for all time.
\v 17 As for you, if you walk before me as David your father walked, obeying all that I have commanded you and keeping my statutes and my decrees,
\v 18 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, as I said in a covenant with David your father, when I said, ‘A descendant of yours will never fail to be ruler in Israel.'
 
\p
\v 19 But if you turn away, and forsake my statutes and my commandments that I have placed before you, and if you go worship other gods and bow down to them, 
\v 20 then I will uproot them from out of my ground that I have given them; and this house that I have consecrated for my name—I will cast it away from before me, and I will make it a proverb and a joke among all the peoples.
