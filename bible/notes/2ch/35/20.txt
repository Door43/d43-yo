\v 20 After all this, after Josiah had set the temple in order, Neco, king of Egypt, went up to fight against Carchemish at the Euphrates River, and Josiah went to fight against him.
\v 21 But Neco sent ambassadors to him, saying, “What have I to do with you, king of Judah? I am not coming against you today, but against the house with which I am making war. God has commanded me to hurry, so refrain from interfering with God, who is with me, or he might destroy you.”
