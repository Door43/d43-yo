\v 9 But Hezekiah asked the priests and other descendants of Levi, "What are these heaps of things?"
\v 10 Then Azariah the high priest, a descendant of Zadok, replied, "Since the time that the people started to bring their offerings to the temple, we have had even more food than we need. This has happened because Yahweh has greatly blessed our fellow Israelites, with the result that all this is left over after we priests and other descendants of Levi took all that we need!"


\p
\v 11 Then Hezekiah ordered that they should prepare storerooms at the temple to hold these supplies.
\v 12 Then they brought into the storerooms all the tithes and offerings and things and the things dedicated to Yahweh which the people had brought. One of the descendants of Levi whose name was Conaniah was in charge of those things, and his younger brother Shimei was his assistant.

\v 9 Then Hezekiah questioned the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
\v 10 Azariah, the chief priest, of the house of Zadok, answered him and said, “Since
the people began to bring the offerings into the house of Yahweh, we have eaten and had enough, and have 
plenty left over, for Yahweh has blessed his people. What was left over is this large amount here.” 
 
\p
\v 11 Then Hezekiah commanded for storerooms to be prepared in the house of Yahweh, and they prepared them.
\v 12 Then they faithfully brought in the offerings, tithes and the consecrated things. Conaniah, the Levite,
was the manager in charge of them, and Shimei, his brother, was second to him.
\v 13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and
Benaiah were managers under the hand of Conaniah and Shimei his brother, by appointment of Hezekiah, the king, and Azariah, the official over the house of God.
