\v 8 In Jehoramâ€™s days, Edom revolted from the power of Judah, and they set a king over themselves.
\v 9 Then Jehoram crossed over with his commanders and all his chariots. It happened that he rose up at night and struck down the Edomites, who had surrounded him and the commanders of the chariots.
\v 10 So Edom has been in rebellion from the power of Judah to this present day. Libnah also revolted at the same time from his power, because Jehoram had forsaken Yahweh, the God of his ancestors.
