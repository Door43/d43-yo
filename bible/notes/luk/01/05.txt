===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **In the days of Herod, king of Judea**  – "During the time that King Herod was ruling over Judea"
  * **Judea**  – This could be translated as "the region of Judea" or "Judea Region." Some languages may prefer to say "the people who lived in Judea."
  * **there was a certain**  - "there was a particular" or "there was a." This is a way of introducing an important character in a story. Consider how your language does this.
  * **division**  - This could be translated as "division of priests" or "group of priests."
  * **of Abijah**  - "who descended from Abijah." Abijah was an ancestor of this group of priests and all of them were descended from Aaron, who was the first Israelite priest.
  * **His wife**  - This could be translated as "Zechariah's wife."
  * **was from the daughters of**  - "was also one of the descendants of" or "was also descended from Aaron." This could also be translated as "Zechariah and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from Aaron."
  * **before God**  - "in God's sight" or "in God's opinion"

  * **all the Lord's commandments and requirements**  - This could be translated as "all that the Lord had commanded and required."
  * **But**  – This contrast word shows that what follows here is the opposite of what is expected. People expected that if they did what was right, God would allow them to have children. Although this couple did what was right, they did not have any children.
