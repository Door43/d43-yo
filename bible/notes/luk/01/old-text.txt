<sup>1</sup> Many people have **undertaken** to write an orderly **account** about those matters **which have been fulfilled** among **us**. <sup>2</sup> These events were reported to **us** by those who **from the beginning** were **eyewitnesses** and became **servants of the word**. <sup>3</sup> So, since I also have accurately **researched** everything that happened from the beginning, I thought it would be good for me to write it down for you in an orderly way, **most excellent Theophilus**, <sup>4</sup> so that you might know that the things which you were taught are true.

\c 1 \p \v 1-2 Many people saw from the beginning the things that God did among us. They served \bd God\bd* by telling us about what they had seen. Many of them also wrote down accounts of those things. \v 3 I myself have carefully studied these accounts from the beginning. So, honorable Theophilus, I decided that it would be good for me also to write for you \f + \ft singular pronoun\f*  an accurate account of these matters. \v 4 I am doing this so that you might know that what you have been taught is true.

<sup>5</sup> **During the days of Herod, the king of Judea**, there was a **certain priest** named **Zacharias**, **of the division of Abijah**. His wife was **from the daughters of Aaron**, and her name was Elizabeth. <sup>6</sup> They were both **righteous** **before God**, **walking blamelessly in all the commandments and requirements** of the **Lord**. <sup>7</sup> But they did not have a child, because Elizabeth was **barren**, and they both were **advanced in days**.


==== UTB ====

<usfm> \p \v 5 When King Herod ruled Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah. He belonged to the group of Jewish priests called the Abijah group. He and his wife Elizabeth were both descended from Aaron, the first priest of Israel. \v 6 They were both righteous in God's sight; they always obeyed all of the Lord's commandments and regulations. \v 7 But they had no children, because Elizabeth was unable to bear children. Furthermore, they both were very old.

<sup>8</sup> Now while he was serving as **priest** **before God** in the order of his division, <sup>9</sup> **according to the custom of the priest’s office**, he was **chosen by lot** to enter into the **temple** of the **Lord** to burn **incense**. <sup>10</sup> A large group of people was **praying** **outside** during **the hour of incense**.

<usfm>
\p \v 8 When Zechariah and the other priests in his group were serving in God's presence, \v 9 they followed their custom and chose him by lot to enter the temple and burn incense. \v 10 While he was burning the incense at the appointed time, many people were praying outside in the courtyard.

<sup>11</sup> **An angel of the Lord** **appeared to him**, **standing** at the **right side** of the **altar of incense**. <sup>12</sup> **Zacharias** was troubled when he saw him, and became very afraid. <sup>13</sup> But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because **your request has been heard**, **and your wife**, **Elizabeth**, **will bear you a son**, and you will **call his name John**.


==== UTB ====

<usfm> \v 11 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Zechariah. The angel was standing at the right side of the altar of incense. \v 12 When Zechariah saw the angel, he was startled and became very afraid. \v 13 But the angel said to him, "Zechariah, do not be afraid! God has heard your prayer. So your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you \f + \ft singular \f* must name him John. </usfm>

<sup>16</sup> "**He will turn many of the sons of Israel** to the **Lord**, **their God**. <sup>17</sup> He will go **before him** **in the spirit and power of Elijah**, **to turn back the hearts of fathers to children**, and **the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous**, **to prepare a people** who will be ready for the Lord."

<usfm>
\v 16 He will cause many of Israel's descendants to turn back to the Lord their God. \v 17 He will go to the people ahead of the Lord, with the same spirit and power that the prophet Elijah had.

<sup>18</sup> **Zacharias** said to the **angel**, “**How can I be sure of this**? For I am an old man, and my wife **is very advanced in days**.” <sup>19</sup> The angel answered him, “I am **Gabriel**, who **stands before God**. **I was sent** to speak to you, and **to tell this good news** to you. <sup>20</sup> **Indeed**, **you will be silent and not be able to speak**, until the day when these things happen, because **you did not believe my words**, **which will be fulfilled** **in their proper time**.”

<usfm>
\p \v 18 Then Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I know for sure that this will happen?

<sup>21</sup> The people were waiting for Zacharias, and they wondered why he stayed so long in the temple. <sup>22</sup> When he came out, he could not speak to them, and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple.

<usfm> \p \v 21 Meanwhile, the people in the courtyard were waiting for Zechariah, and they were surprised that he stayed in the temple for such a long time. \v 22 When he came out, he could not speak to them. They realized that he had seen a vision in the temple, because he kept gesturing to them and remained unable to speak. \p \v 23 When Zechariah's time to work as a priest in the temple was finished, he left Jerusalem and returned to his home. </usfm>

<sup>24</sup> After these days, Elizabeth, his wife, became pregnant. She hid herself for five months, saying, <sup>25</sup> “The Lord has done this for me in the days in which he watched over me, to take away my disgrace among men.”

<sup>26</sup> Now in her sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth, <sup>27</sup> to a virgin who was promised to be married to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David.

<usfm> 
\p \v 26 When Elizabeth had been pregnant for almost six months, God sent the angel Gabriel \v 27 to a town called Nazareth in the region of Galilee, to a virgin whose name was Mary.

<sup>30</sup> The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. <sup>31</sup> Indeed, you will become pregnant in your womb, and give birth to a son, and will call his name ‘Jesus.’ <sup>32</sup> He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High.

<usfm> \v 30 Then the angel said to her, "Do not be afraid, Mary.

<sup>34</sup> Mary said to the angel, “How can this happen, since I am a virgin?” <sup>35</sup> The angel answered her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. Therefore also the holy one who is born will be called the Son of God.

<sup>36</sup> Indeed, Elizabeth, your relative, also has become pregnant with a son in her old age; and this is the sixth month for the one who was called barren. <sup>37</sup> For nothing is impossible with God.” <sup>38</sup> Mary said, “I am indeed the servant of the Lord.

==== UTB ====

<usfm> \v 36 And listen to this. Even your relative Elizabeth is pregnant with a son, though she is very old. And though people thought that she could not bear children, she has now been pregnant for almost six months. \v 37 Nothing is impossible for God to do!" \v 38 Then Mary said, "All right.

<sup>39</sup> Mary arose in those days and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah, <sup>40</sup> and entered into the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth. <sup>41</sup> When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.

<usfm> \q \v 54-55 He has helped Israel, the people who serve him. \q Long ago he promised our ancestors that he would be merciful to them. \q He has kept that promise and has always acted mercifully toward Abraham and his descendants. </usfm>

<usfm> \p \v 56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth for about three months.

==== UTB ====

<usfm> \v 59 When the baby was eight days old, they gathered together to circumcise the baby.

==== UTB ====

<usfm>
\v 62 Then they made motions with their hands to ask his father what name \add he\add* wanted to give to his son. \v 63 \add So\add* he signaled that they \add should give him\add* a tablet \add to write on. When they gave him one\add*, he wrote \add on it\add*, "His name is John." Everyone \add who was there\add* was surprised! 
</usfm>


==== UTB ====

<usfm>
\v 64 Immediately Zechariah was able to speak again \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and he praised God. \v 65 All their neighbors were frightened\f + \ft Or: awestruck \f*! They told other people who lived all over the highlands of Judea about what had happened. \v 66 Everyone who heard about it kept thinking about it.
