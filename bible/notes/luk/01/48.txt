===== Translation Notes: =====

  * (Mary continues to praise God:)
  * **lowly** - "unimportant" or "ordinary" or "simple" or "poor." Mary did not have high social standing.
  * **paid attention** - "thought about" or "remembered." It could be translated as "did not forget." This is not an issue of God's ability to remember, but his choosing to remember.
  * **from now on** - “now and in the future”
  * **the Mighty One** - This refers to God. It could be translated as "God, the Powerful One."
  * **his name** - "he"
