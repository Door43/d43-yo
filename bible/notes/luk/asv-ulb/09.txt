\c 9
\p
\v 1 And he called the twelve together, and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.
\v 2 And he sent them forth to preach the kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.
\v 3 And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staff, nor wallet, nor bread, nor money; neither have two
coats.
\v 4 And into whatever house you enter, there abide, and thence depart.
\v 5 And as many as receive you not, when you depart from that city, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against
them.
\v 6 And they departed, and went throughout the villages, preaching the gospel, and healing everywhere.
\p
\v 7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all that was done: and he was much perplexed, because that it was said by some, that John
was risen from the dead;
\v 8 and by some, that Elijah had appeared; and by others, that one of the old prophets was risen again.
\v 9 And Herod said, John I beheaded: but who is this, about whom I hear such things? And he sought to see him.
\p
\v 10 And the apostles, when they were returned, declared to him what things they had done. And he took them, and withdrew
apart to a city called Bethsaida.
\v 11 But the multitudes perceiving it followed him: and he welcomed them, and spoke to them of the kingdom of God, and them
that had need of healing he cured.
\v 12 And the day began to wear away; and the twelve came, and said to him, Send the multitude away, that they may go into
the villages and country round about, and lodge, and get provisions: for we are here in a desert place.
\v 13 But he said to them, Give you them to eat. And they said, We have no more than five loaves and two fishes; except we
should go and buy food for all this people.
\v 14 For they were about five thousand men. And he said to his disciples, Make them sit down in companies, about fifty each.
\v 15 And they did so, and made them all sit down.
\v 16 And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, he blessed them, and brake; and gave to the
disciples to set before the multitude.
\v 17 And they ate, and were all filled: and there was taken up that which remained over to them of broken pieces, twelve
baskets.
\p
\v 18 And it came to pass, as he was praying apart, the disciples were with him: and he asked them, saying, Who do the
multitudes say that I am?
\v 19 And they answering said, John the Baptist; but others \add say\add*, Elijah; and others, that one of the old prophets is
risen again.
\v 20 And he said to them, But who say you that I am? And Peter answering said, The Christ of God.
\v 21 But he charged them, and commanded \add them\add* to tell this to no man;
\v 22 saying, The Son of man must suffer many things, and be rejected of the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be
killed, and the third day be raised up.
\v 23 And he said to all, If any man would come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.
\v 24 For whoever would save his life shall lose it; but whoever shall lose his life for my sake, the same shall save it.
\v 25 For what is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?
\v 26 For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words, of him shall the Son of man be ashamed, when he comes in his own
glory, and \add the glory \add* of the Father, and of the holy angels.
\v 27 But I tell you of a truth, There are some of them that stand here, who shall in no wise taste of death, till they see the
kingdom of God.
\p
\v 28 And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings, that he took with him Peter and John and James, and went up
into the mountain to pray.
\v 29 And as he was praying, the fashion of his countenance was altered, and his raiment
\add became\add* white \add and\add* dazzling.
\v 30 And behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah;
\v 31 who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
\v 32 Now Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: but when they were fully awake, they saw his glory, and the
two men that stood with him.
\v 33 And it came to pass, as they were parting from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let
us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.
\v 34 And while he said these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the
cloud.
\v 35 And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, This is my Son, my chosen: hear you him.
\v 36 And when the voice came, Jesus was found alone. And they held their peace, and told no man in those days any of the
things which they had seen.
\p
\v 37 And it came to pass, on the next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.
\v 38 And behold, a man from the multitude cried, saying, Teacher, I beseech you to look upon my son; for he is mine only
child:
\v 39 and behold, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and it hardly departs
from him, bruising him sorely.
\v 40 And I implored your disciples to cast it out; and they could not.
\v 41 And Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and bear with you? bring
hither your son.
\v 42 And as he was yet a coming, the demon dashed him down, and tare
\add him\add* grievously. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
\v 43 And they were all astonished at the majesty of God.
\p But while all were marvelling at all the things which he did, he said to his disciples,
\v 44 Let these words sink into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.
\v 45 But they understood not this saying, and it was concealed from them, that they should not perceive it; and they were
afraid to ask him about this saying.
\p
\v 46 And there arose a reasoning among them, which of them was the greatest.
\v 47 But when Jesus saw the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side,
\v 48 and said to them, Whosoever shall receive this little child in my name receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me
receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same is great.
\p
\v 49 And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in your name; and we forbade him, because he follows
not with us.
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, Forbid \add him\add* not: for he that is not against you is for you.
\p
\v 51 And it came to pass, when the days were well-nigh come that he should be received up, he stedfastly set his face to go to
Jerusalem,
\v 52 and sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.
\v 53 And they did not receive him, because his face was \add as though he
were\add* going to Jerusalem.
\v 54 And when his disciples James and John saw \add this\add*, they said, Lord, will you that we command fire to come down from
heaven, and consume them?
\v 55 But he turned, and rebuked them.
\v 56 And they went to another village.
\p
\v 57 And as they went on the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow you wherever you goest.
\v 58 And Jesus said to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the heaven
\add have\add* nests; but the Son of man has not where to lay his head.
\v 59 And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.
\v 60 But he said to him, Leave the dead to bury their own dead; but go you and publish abroad the kingdom of God.
\v 61 And another also said, I will follow thee, Lord; but first suffer me to command farewell to them that are at my house.
\v 62 But Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.
