====== Development Page for Checking ======

This is the "working page" to organize and develop Checking resources. This page will not be visible to the end-users.

Andy's initial comments about Checking are here: [[:yo:bible:notes:luk:questions:checking:luke-checking|Luke Checking Questions]]

We are developing the Checking resources to parallel the three levels of approval for UnfoldingWord.

==== Level 1 Checking (Translator) ====

Level 1 checking will be done by the translator or translation group. It is assumed that they will be native speakers of or fluent in the language. The purpose of this level is to verify that:

  - the translation was done according to the translation notes
  - the translator tested the translation with other local speakers of the language

Level 1 Checking is explained here: [[:yo:bible:notes:luk:questions:checking:level1:level1|Level 1 Checking]]

==== Level 2 Checking (Language Community) ====

Level 2 checking will be done by a wider group of people from the language community. It is assumed that they will be native speakers of the language. The purpose of this level of checking is to verify that a larger group of the target population agrees that the translation is a good one.

Level 2 Checking is explained here: [[:yo:bible:notes:luk:questions:checking:level2:level2|Level 2 Checking]]

==== Level 3 Checking (Recognized Organization) ====

Level 3 checking will be done by a recognized group or organization in order to verify that they approve of the distribution and use of the translation among the people affiliated with them. This approval is not required for distribution of the translation, but rather serves to validate it.

Level 3 Checking is explained here: [[:yo:bible:notes:luk:questions:checking:level3:level3|Level 3 Checking]]
