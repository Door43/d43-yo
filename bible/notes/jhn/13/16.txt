<usfm>
\v 16 Listen to this carefully: A servant is not greater than his master. A messenger is not greater than the one who has sent him. \add So, since you are not greater than I am, you should not be proud and unwilling to serve each other\add*.
\v 17 Since you now know these things, \add God will\add* be pleased with you if you do them."


\p
\v 18 "I am not saying that \add God will bless\add* all of you. I knew \add what all of you were like when\add* I chose you. But \add I also chose the one who will betray me\add*, in order that what is written in Scripture might be fulfilled \f + \ft Or:to fulfill what someone, Or: the psalmist wrote in Scripture \f*, 'The one who is \add acting like he is my friend by\add* eating with me has become my enemy \f + \ft idiom \f*.'

\v 16 I am telling you the truth: a servant is not greater than his master, nor is a messenger greater than the one who has sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, how fortunate you will be if you do them.


\p
\v 18 I am not saying this about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. However, what is written in Scripture must come true: ‘The one who ate my food with me as a friend, he has turned against me and treated me like an enemy.'

\v 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a servant is not greater than his master; neither is the one who has been sent greater than the one who sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
\v 18 I am not speaking about all of you, for I know those whom I have chosen—but I say this so that the scripture may be fulfilled: 'He who eats my bread lifted up his heel against me.'
