<usfm>
\v 6 So Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square in front of the king’s gate.
\v 7 Mordecai reported to him all that had happened to him, and the total amount of the silver that Haman had promised to weigh out and put into the king’s treasuries in order to put the Jews to death.
\v 8 He also gave him a copy of the decree that was issued in Susa for the Jews' destruction. He did this so that Hathach could show it to Esther, and that he should give her the responsibility of going to the king to beg for his favor, and to plead with him on behalf of her people.
