\v 5 When Haman learned that Mordecai refused to kneel down or prostrate himself to him, he became extremely angry.
\v 6 He was too proud to want to punish only Mordecai. Because the king's servants had made it known that Mordecai was Jewish, Haman wanted all the Jews to be killed. So this matter became an opportunity to kill all the Jews everywhere in Ahasuerus' kingdom.
