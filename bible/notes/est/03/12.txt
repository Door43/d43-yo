The order was written in every language and in the writing of those languages so they could be read and understood.It was written in the name of King Ahasuerus and was sealed with the his own ring, which he had given to Haman to use.
\v 13 Couriers in every province in the kingdom spread the decree. The order was to kill every Jew, to kill them all, and to destroy the Jewish people, from young to old, children and women.
