<usfm>
\v 15 There are leeches that such blood, imagine they had two daughters;
\q2 they say, "Give to us! Give to us! 
\q1 There are four things that are never satisfiedâ€”
\q2 they always want more :
\q1
\v 16 The grave, the place of the dead;
\q1 the womb of a woman that never conceived a child; 
\q1 soil that badly needs to be watered;
\q1 and a fire that burns hot and it never says, "The Fire is Hot Enough!".
\b
\q1
\v 17 The one who dishonors his father, 
\q2 and who disrespects and disobeys his mother. 
\q1 such a person would be killed and have his eyes pecked out by crows,
\q2 and would be devoured by the vultures.


\q1

<usfm>
\q
\v 15 The leech has two daughters, "Give and give," they cry.
\q There are three things that are never satisfied,
\q four that never say, "Enough":
\q
\v 16 Sheol; the barren womb;
\q land thirsty for water;
\q and the fire that never says, "Enough."
\q
\v 17 The eye that mocks a father,
\q and scorns obedience to a mother,
\q his eyes will be pecked out by the ravens of the valley,
\q and he will be eated by the vultures.
