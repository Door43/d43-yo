    * **they cannot sleep until they do evil, and they are robbed of sleep until they cause someone to stumble**  - Both parts of the verse mean "the wicked are compelled by something inside them to do evil. (See: [[:yo:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])
    * **they eat the bread of wickedness**  - the wicked live by wickedness (See: [[:yo:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
