    * **Should your springs overflow everywhere, your streams of water flow in the public squares?**  - The phrases "your springs overflow everywhere" and "your stream of water flow in the public squares" are euphemisms for sexual promiscuity and possibly the illegitimate children resulting from such promiscuity.
