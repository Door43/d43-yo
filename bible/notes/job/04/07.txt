\v 7 Think about this: Do innocent people die \add while they are still young\add* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*?
\q2 Does God get rid of godly people \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*? \add No\add*!
\q1
\v 8 What I have experienced is this: \add Just as\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* farmers who plant bad \add seeds\add* do not harvest \add good crops\add*,
\q2 \add those who start\add* trouble for others later bring trouble on themselves.

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Think about this: No innocent people ever die when they are still young!
\q2 God never kills innocent people!
\q1
\v 8 I have seen this happen: if farmers plant bad seeds, they do not harvest good crops;
\q2 anyone who starts trouble for others later brings trouble on himself.
\q1
\v 9 These people die when God commands them to,
\q2 because he is very angry with them.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 7 Think about this, I beg you: who has ever perished when innocent?
\q Or when was the upright person ever cut off?
\q
\v 8 Based on what I have observed, those who plow iniquity
\q and sow trouble, reap the same.
\q
\v 9 By the breath of God they perish;
\q by the blast of his anger they are consumed.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **Think about this, I beg you** - "Please recall"
  * **who has ever perished when innocent?** - Eliphaz uses this question to prompt Job to search his life for sin (and God's righteous judgment) as the cause of his loss. AT: "No one has ever perished when innocent." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
  * **when was the upright person ever cut off?** - This question has the same purpose as the previous question.  AT: "Who has ever perished when innocent?" or "No upright person was ever cut off." 
  * **plow iniquity … sow trouble … reap** - The words "plow," "sow," and "reap" are agricultural terms used figuratively here to suggest that people sometimes bring trouble upon themselves through their choices and actions. 
  * **By the breath of God they perish; by the blast of his anger they are consumed** - The writer explains a single idea using two different statements. This is a form of Hebrew poetry used for emphasis, clarity, teaching, or all three. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])  
  * **breath … blast** - These are synonyms. They say the same thing using different words.
  * **perish … are consumed** - These are synonyms. They say the same thing using different words, conveying the destruction which God can cause.
