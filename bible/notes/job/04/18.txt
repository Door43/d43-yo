\v 18 God cannot be sure that his own angels \add will always do what is right\add*;
\q2 he declares that some of them have done what is wrong.

\q
\v 18 See, if God puts no trust in his servants;
\q if he accuses his angels of folly,

\q whose foundation is in the dust,
\q who are crushed sooner than a moth?
