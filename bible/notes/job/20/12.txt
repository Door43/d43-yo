\v 12 Although doing wicked things was like having sweet food in their mouths
\q2 that they wanted to continue tasting,
\q1
\v 13 and although they did not want to stop doing those things,

<usfm>
\q
\v 12 Although wickedness is sweet in his mouth,
\q although he hides it under his tongue,
\q
\v 13 although he holds it there and does not let it go
\q but keeps it still in his mouthâ€”
\q
\v 14 the food in his intestines turns bitter;
\q it becomes the poison of asps inside him.
