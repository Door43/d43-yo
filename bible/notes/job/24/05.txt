\q
\v 5 See, like wild donkeys in the desert,
\q these poor people go out to their work, looking carefully for food;
\q perhaps the Arabah will provide them food for their children.
\q
\v 6 The poor reap in the night in other peopleâ€™s fields;
\q they glean grapes from the harvest of the wicked.
\q
\v 7 They lie naked all night without clothing;
\q they have no covering in the cold.
