\q
\v 24 These people are exalted; still, in only a little while, they will be gone;
\q indeed, they will be brought low; they will be gathered up like all the others;
\q they will be cut off like the tops of the ears of grain.
\q
\v 25 If it is not so, who can prove me to be a liar;
\q who can make my speech worth nothing?‚Äù
