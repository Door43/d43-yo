\v 10 But when we people lose all our strength and die,
\q2 we stop breathing, and then we are gone forever.
\q1
\v 11 Just as water evaporates from a lake,
\q2 or as a riverbed dries up,
\q1
\v 12 people lie down and die and do not get up again.
\q1 Until the heavens do not exist any longer;
\q2 people who die do not wake up,
\q2 and no one can wake them up.

<usfm>
\q
\v 10 But man dies and is laid low;
\q indeed, man gives up his spirit, and then where is he?
\q
\v 11 As water disappears from a lake,
\q as a river loses water and dries up,
\q
\v 12 So people lie down and do not rise again.
\q Until the heavens are no more, they will not awake
\q nor be roused out of their sleep.
\b
