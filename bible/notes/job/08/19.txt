===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **See, this is the 'joy' of such a person's behavior** - The word "joy" is used ironically. The only happiness that can come out of a godless life is being forgotten after you die. "See, this is the joy of the godless person's path." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_irony]])
  * **behavior** - "actions" or "way of life"
  * **other plants will sprout up from the same soil in his place** - Here the writer continues the metaphor from [[en:bible:notes:job:08:16|08:16-18]]. Godless people are compared to other plants that grow among rocks. Neither the people nor the plants will flourish. AT: "When one wicked man dies, another will take his place" or "From the soil, another will grow." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **sprout up** - "grow"
  * **same soil** - "the rocky ground"
  * **in his place** - "in the place of the godless man"
  * **neither will he take the hand of evildoers** - "he will not support evildoers" or "he will not stregthen evildoers" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom]])
