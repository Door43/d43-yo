===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to emphasize the people's capacity to learn from their ancestors, given the brevity of life and the ancestors' willingness to impart teachings. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **For inquire, I beg you, about ages past** - "For inquire, I beg you, about earlier generations"
  * **apply yourself to learn what those people discovered** - "pay attention to what our ancestors discovered" or "consider what our forefathers discovered"
  * **our days on earth are like a shadow** - In this simile, life is compared to a shadow; both pass by quickly. The Hebrew text expresses this as a metaphor. AT: "Our days on earth are a shadow" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * ** Will they not teach you and tell you, Will they not utter words from their hearts?** - Bildad poses this question to rebuke Job. AT: "Will they not teach you, tell you, and from their understanding bring forth words?" (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
