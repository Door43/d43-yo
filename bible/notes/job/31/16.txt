\v 16-18 I have guided orphans from the time that they were born;

\q2 or that I refused to give poor people the things that they wanted,
\q2 or that I caused widows to live in despair\f + \ft Or: without hope \add that they would receive any help from anyone\add* \f*,

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 16 If I have withheld the poor from their desire,
\q or if I have caused the eyes of the widow to grow dim from crying,
\q
\v 17 or if I have eaten my morsel alone
\q and not allowed the fatherless to eat it also—
\q
\v 18 (instead, from my youth the orphan grew up with me as with a father,
\q and I have guided his mother, a widow, from my own mother’s womb)—
