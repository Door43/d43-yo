===== Translation Notes: =====

The writer continues to use parallelism in each of these verses, conveying a single idea using two different statements to depict God as Creator. (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

  * **It is the same God who tells the sun not to rise, and it does not** - "It is the same God who commands the sun and could keep it from rising if he wanted to" or "He is the one who speaks to the sun and it does not rise"
  * **who covers up the stars** - "who has control over the stars" or "who blocks the stars from view"
  * **who by himself stretches out the heavens** - This is a figurative description of how the skies range from one horizon to the other.  "who alone stretches out the heavens" 
  * **who tramples down and subdues the waves of the sea** - This is a reference to the creation story in which God controls the chaotic sea.  "who marches on the waves of the sea" or "who calms the waves of the sea"
  * **who makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades** - These refer to constellations, groups of stars picturing individuals and objects. 
  * **Orion** - a group of stars picturing a famous hunter in Greek mythology
  * **Pleiades** - a group of stars picturing seven sisters
