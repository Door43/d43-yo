<usfm>
\q
\v 13 God will not withdraw his anger;
\q the helpers of Rahab bow beneath him.

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **the helpers of Rahab** - "Rahab" seems to be a powerful force of evil or a sea creature.
  * **How much less could I answer him, could I choose words to reason with him?** - Job poses parallel questions to emphasize his reluctance to confront God.  AT: "What could I say to answer or even question him?" (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]] and [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
