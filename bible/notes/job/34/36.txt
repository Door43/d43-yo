<usfm>
\v 36 To you friends of Job, I say this: I think that a court should thoroughly try Job,
\q2 because he answers us, his friends, as wicked men would answer.
\q1
\v 37 To add to the other sins that he has committed, he is rebelling against God;
\q2 he shows us that he does not honor God;
\q2 he makes long speeches saying that God has punished him unjustly."

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 36 If only Job were put on trial in the smallest details of his case
\q because of his talking like wicked men.
\q
\v 37 For he adds rebellion to his sin;
\q he claps his hands in mockery in our midst;
\q he piles up words against God.‚Äù
