\v 10 So listen to me, you men of understanding:
\q far be it from God that he should do wickedness;
\q far be it from the Almighty that he should commit sin.

\q he makes every man come upon the reward of his own ways.

\v 12 Indeed, God does nothing wicked,
\q nor does the Almighty ever pervert justice.
