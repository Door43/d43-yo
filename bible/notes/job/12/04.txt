===== Translation Notes: =====


    * **I am like a laughing stock to my neighbor— I, one who called upon God and was answered by him!
I, a just and perfect man—I am now a laughing stock.**  - This is a figure of speech. Two statements convey one idea. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) "My neighbors mock me, the one who called upon God and he helped me; I, a just and righteous man, am a laughing stock."
    * **In the thought of someone who is at ease, there is contempt for misfortune;**  - This is a figure of speech that emphasizes by stating an obvious universal (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_Truism]]). "Someone who is at ease, has contempt for misfortune."
    * **he thinks in a way that brings more misfortune to those whose foot is slipping.**  - "the way he thinks brings more misfortune to those who are slipping." "you both bring more suffering to those of us who are already troubled."
    * **The tents of robbers prosper,
and those who provoke God feel secure;
their own hands are their gods.**  - This is a figure of speech. It is a rare doublet that has 3 (instead of 2) different statements that state a single thing. (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) "The tents of robbers swell with goods so that those who provoke God feel secure. Their own hands become their Gods."
