===== Translation Notes: =====

    * **Does not the ear test words
just as the palate tastes its food?**  - In this figure of speech, words are tested using hearing just as food is tested using hearing for to determing if it is good or bad. (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_simile]]) and it is stated as a question that does not expect an answer to emphasize and teach the meaning (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) AT: The ear tests words just as the palate tests food.
    * **With aged men is wisdom;
in length of days is understanding.**  - This is a classic figure of speech. It says very similar things about exactly the same thing (see: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]]) "Wisdom and understanding accompany men of age and length of days."
