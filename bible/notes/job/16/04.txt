<usfm>
\v 4 If it were you three and not I who were suffering,
\q2 I could, in your place, say the things that you are saying.
\q1 I could make great speeches to criticize you,
\q2 and I could shake my head at you to ridicule you.
\q1
\v 5 Then you would see whether my words encouraged you or not;
\q2 you would see whether they made you feel your pain less.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\q
\v 4 I also could speak as you do;
\q if your soul were in my soulâ€™s place,
\q I could collect and join words together against you
\q and shake my head at you in mockery.
\q
\v 5 Oh, how I would encourage you with my mouth!
\q how the comfort from my lips would lighten your grief!
\b
