\v 17 Then they will sing a sad song about the city, like this:
\q1 'The famous city, in which many men who sailed on the seas lived,
\q2 is now no more!
\q1 The people of that city had great power as they sailed, but now they are at the bottom of the sea;
\q2 they terrified all the people living near them.
\q1
\v 18 But now everyone living along the coast is terrified because the enemy has destroyed the great city.
\q2 It is as though the land along the coast itself were trembling; the people on 
\q1 the islands in the sea are terrified because of that city exists no more.'

\v 17 They will lift up a lament for you and say concerning you,
\q 'How you who were inhabited by sailors has been destroyed! The famous city that was so strongâ€”it is now in the sea!
\q And you, the ones living in her who placed terror of yourselves on everyone else who lived there,
\q
\v 18 now the coasts tremble  on the day of your downfall!
\q The coasts are terrified, because you have gone out into the waters!
