\v 5 Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes to the north." So I lifted up my eyes to the north, and to the north of the gate leading to the altar, there in the entrance, was the  idol of jealousy.
\v 6 So he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing? These are great abominations that the house of Israel is doing here to make me go far from my own sanctuary! But you will turn and see even greater abominations!"
