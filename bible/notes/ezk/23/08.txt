\v 8 For she had not left her prostitute behavior behind in Egypt, when they had slept with her when she had been a young girl, when they first began to fondle her virgin nipples, when they first began to pour out their promiscuous behavior on her. 
\v 9 Therefore I gave her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians for whom she lusted!
\v 10 They stripped her naked. They took her sons and daughters, and they killed her with the sword, and she became shameful to other women, so they passed judgment on her.
