\v 5 Oholah acted like a prostitute while she was still my wife. She desired to have sex with those she loved—soldiers from Assyria.
\v 6 Some of them were army officers and commanders. They wore beautiful blue uniforms. They were all handsome young men. Some of them rode horses.
\v 7 She acted like a prostitute toward all the important Assyrian officials, and became unacceptable to me by worshiping all the idols of the men she wanted to have sex with.

\v 5 But Oholah acted as a prostitute even when she was mine; she lusted for her lovers, for the Assyrians who were dominant,
\v 6 the governor who wore violet, and for his officials, who were strong and handsome, all of them men riding on horses!
\v 7 So she gave herself as a prostitute to them, to all the best of Assyria’s men! And she made herself unclean with everyone for whom she lusted, with all their idols for whom she lusted.
