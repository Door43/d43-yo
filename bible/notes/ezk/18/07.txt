<usfm>
\v 7 if he has not oppressed anyone but instead has returned a pledge to its debtor—if he has not taken what was stolen, but instead gives his food to 
the hungry and covers the naked with clothes; 
 

\v 8 if he does not charge any interest for loans, nor takes excessive profit—if he carries out justice and establishes faithfulness between people—
\v 9 if he walks in my statutes and keeps my decrees to act faithfully—this man is righteous; he will live!"—this is the Lord Yahweh’s declaration.
