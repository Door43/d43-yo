They made offerings to them, and that caused me to become angry. They presented to those idols their fragrant burning incense, and poured out wine offerings to them.

\v 27 Therefore, Son of man, announce this to the house of Israel; say to them, ‘The Lord Yahweh says this: "Your fathers blasphemed me by  betraying me against me. They did it in this way:
\v 28 when I brought them into the land that I lifted my hand to give to them, and when they saw all the high hills and leafy trees, then they offered their 
sacrifices there and provoked me by their offerings there. There they also burned fragrant incense and poured out drink offerings.
\v 29 Then I said to them, 'What is this high place where you bring offerings there?' So the name is called Bamah to this day." '
