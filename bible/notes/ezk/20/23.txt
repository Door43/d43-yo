<usfm>
\v 23 So I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among many people groups,

<usfm>
\v 23 I myself also raised my hand to them in the wilderness, in order to swear that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them among the lands.
\v 24 I decided to do this since they had not obeyed my decrees, and since they had rejected my statutes and profaned my Sabbaths. Their eyes were longing after their fathers’ idols.
