<usfm>
\v 22 When that happens, you will do like I have done: you will not cover the lower part of your faces, or eat the kinds of food that people who are mourning usually eat.
\v 23 You will keep your turbans wrapped around your heads and keep your sandals on your feet. You will not mourn or cry, but your bodies will become very thin and slowly die because of your sins. And you will groan to each other.
\v 24 Ezekiel will be a warning to you, and you must do what he has done. When that happens, you will know that I, Yahweh the Lord \add have the power to do what I say that I will do\add*.'

\v 22 Then you will do exactly as I have done: you will not veil your facial hair, nor eat the bread of mourning men!
\v 23 Instead, your turbans will be on your heads, and your sandals on your feet; you will not mourn nor weep, for you will melt away in your iniquities, and each man will groan for his brother.
\v 24 So Ezekiel will be a sign for you, as everything that he has done you will do when this comes. Then you will know that I am the Lord Yahweh!'"
