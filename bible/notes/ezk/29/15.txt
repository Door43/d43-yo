\v 15 It will be the least important of all the nations; it will never again be greater than the nearby countries. Yahweh says that he will cause Egypt to be very weak, and that they will never again rule over other nations.
\v 16 When that happens, the leaders of Israel will no longer think of asking Egypt to help them. When Yahweh punishes Egypt, the Israelites will be reminded that they previously sinned by trusting that Egypt could help them. And the people of Israel will know that Yahweh the Lord has the power to do what he says he will do."
