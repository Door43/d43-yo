===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **inhabitants of** - "people who live in"
  * **Because they have been a reed stalk** -  "for to Israel, you have been a weak ally". Reed stalk refers to a stiff rod that is weak and is easily broken. In times of trouble, Egypt would not come to help Israel. (See: Metaphor).
  * **the house of Israel!** -  "the people of Israel" or "the nation of Israel."
  * **When they seize you in the palm, you will be crushed and every shoulder divided** - "When Egypt reaches out a hand in friendship, Israel will be harmed".  The palm is a part of the hand. (See: Metaphor).
  * **and when they leaned on you** - "and as Israel relied on Egypt". The reference of the word "they" changes here.
  * **you shattered and made every loin stand up** - "you did not help and greatly hurt her back."
