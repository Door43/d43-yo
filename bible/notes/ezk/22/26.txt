\v 27 Their officials are like \f + \ft simile \f* wolves that tear apart the animals that they have killed: they murder people \f + \ft doublet \f* in order to get their money.
\v 28 Their prophets try to cover up \f + \ft metaphor \f*\f + \ft Or: say that it is all right to commit \f*those sins by falsely saying they have received visions \add from God\add*, and giving false messages. They say, 'This is what Yahweh the Lord says' when I have said nothing to them.

<usfm>
\v 26 Her priests do violence to my Law, and they profane my holy things. They do not distinguish between holy things and  profane things, and do not teach the difference 
between the unclean and the clean. They hide their eyes from my Sabbaths so that I am profaned in their midst!
\v 27 Her princes in her midst are like wolves rending victims to pour out blood, to destroy souls in order to gain unjust profit by violence.
\v 28 And her prophets have painted them over with whitewash; they see false visions and predict falsehoods to them. they say “The Lord Yahweh says this” 
when Yahweh has not spoken!
