\v 12 \add You also asked\add* about our fellow believer, Apollos. I urged him strongly that he should go back to you with the three fellow believers \add who came here from Corinth\add*. He was not at all willing to go \add now\add*, but he will go later, when he has an opportunity.

\v 10 Now when Timothy comes, treat him kindly and see to it that he has nothing to be afraid of, for he is doing the Lord's work, just like I am doing.
\v 11 Do not let anyone be unkind to him. Help him on his way as much as you can; send him away in peace so that he may join me. I am expecting him to travel with other brothers who are coming my way. 
\p
\v 12 You asked about our brother Apollos. I urged him strongly that he should visit you when the other brothers came to you. He decided not to come now, but he will come to you later when he has opportunity.
