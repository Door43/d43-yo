3.  we should add “understand” to the “know” entry. (1 Cor 2:8-9))

4. On the quick reference guide there are several standard notes for the word 'now', however none of them seem appropriate for the 'now's we keep running across in 1 Corinthians. How should this problem be addressed? (2:6-7)

5. KEY TERMS - we should add key terms for foreordain, age. Also, the definition of “mature” should be added to the KT “perfect”. (2:6-7)
