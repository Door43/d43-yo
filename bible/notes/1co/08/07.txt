\v 7 Nevertheless, some people do not understand \add that idols are not really alive\add*. In the past, some among you who are believers now were accustomed to believing that idols \add were really alive\add*. As a result, when they eat such meat \add now\add*, they still think that it was sacrificed to an idol \add that is alive\add*. They are not sure \add that God allows believers to eat meat that has been offered to idols\add*. So, \add when they eat such meat\add*, they think that they have sinned.
\v 8 But God will not think more highly about us \add if we eat certain\add* foods, or if we do not eat \add certain foods\add*. That is, we are not more acceptable to God if we do not eat certain foods, nor are we more acceptable to him if we eat those foods.
\v 9 However, be sure that you do not do anything that God allows you to do, if by doing that you would encourage any of \add your fellow believers to do something that\add* they are not sure \add God allows them to do\add*. As a result, you would be causing them to sin.
\v 10 For example, you know \add that idols are not really alive\add*. Suppose that in a temple \add where they worship\add* idols you eat \add food that has been sacrificed to idols\add*. Suppose that someone who is not sure whether God allows us to eat that food sees you eating it. \add You\add* would be encouraging him to eat it, too.\f + \ft Or: Wouldn't \add you\add* be encouraging him to eat it, too? \f* \f + \ft rhetorical question \f*

\v 7 But not everyone knows this.  Some worshiped an idol in earlier times, and, now, if they ate food sacrificed to an idol, they worry that they are still worshiping a god. They were torn between two opinions, they were weak in their faith in Christ, but they felt they were honoring an idol when they bought food that had been offered to it.
\v 8 We know that the food we eat doesn't make us better or worse before God.
\v 9 But what is important is your brother and sister in Christ. You are free to eat that food, but you should not cause a person to fall down in their faith because you have the freedom to eat it.
\v 10 You know that idols were never alive, nor were they gods at all. But if a weak brother sees you eating in an idol's temple, would that not encourage them to turn back to his dolatry?

\v 7 However, this knowledge is not in everyone. Instead, some previously practiced idol worship, and they eat this food as if it were something sacrificed to an idol. Their conscience is thereby corrupted because it is weak. 
\v 8 But food will not recommend us to God. We are not worse if we do not eat, nor better if we do eat it. 
\v 9 But take care that your freedom does not become a reason for someone who is weak in faith to stumble.
\v 10 For if someone sees you, who have knowledge, eating a meal in an idol's temple, is not their conscience, being weak, emboldened to eat what is offered to idols?
