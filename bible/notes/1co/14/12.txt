====== 1 Corinthians 14:12-14 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So \add I say this to\add* you: Because you are eager to have the abilities that God's Spirit gives, earnestly desire those abilities that will do the most to help \add all the believers in\add* the congregation.
\p
\v 13 So, those who have the ability to speak in languages \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add* should pray that \add God will give them the ability to\add* explain the meaning of what they say.
\v 14 If they pray in a language \f + \ft metonymy \f* \add that they have not learned\add*, their spirits are praying, but they are not using their minds.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 So it is important that people understand what you are saying. Try to do the things that encourage the believers in the church to trust Christ and obey him.
\p
\v 13 For that reason, pray that God will enable you to interpret what he says in a language that God has given him.
\v 14 If anyone prays in such a language, his spirit certainly prays, but his mind does not.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 Likewise with you: since you are eager for the manifestations of the Spirit, be zealous to excel in building up the church.
\v 13 So the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret.
\v 14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful.
