\v 35 If they want to know \add more\add* about something \add that a speaker said\add*, they should ask their husbands when they get home, for it is disgraceful for women to \add interrupt a service by\add* asking \add such questions\add*.
\v 36 \add If you do not agree with these things that I have been telling you\add*, remember that \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the message from God did not first come from you \add people in Corinth\add*. Also, you are not \f + \ft rhetorical question \f* the only ones who have heard it! \add Many others have heard it and accepted it, so you should act as the believers in other places act\add*.

\v 34 let the women keep silent in church; they are not permitted to speak. They must not interrupt the one who is speaking God's message, but they should always obey their husbands, as also the Law says.
\v 35 When women want to learn, instead of interrupting the worship, they should speak with their husbands at home. It dishonors her husband for a woman to interrrupt the service.
\v 36 Where you the people by whom God gave us his word? Or are you the only ones to whom it came?

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\p As in all the churches of the saints,
\v 34 the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but they should be in submission, as also the Law says.
\v 35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church.
\v 36 Did the word of God come from you? Are you the only ones it has reached?
