<usfm>
\v 4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
\v 5 or rude. It is not self-serving, it is not easily angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs.
\v 6 It does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices in the truth.
\v 7 Love bears all things, believes all things, has confidence conerning all things, and endures all things.
