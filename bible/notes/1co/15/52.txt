\v 52 \add It will happen\add* suddenly, as \add fast as someone can\add* blink his eye \f + \ft metaphor \f*, when \add we hear the sound of God's\add* trumpet for the last time. When we hear that trumpet, all \add the believers\add* who have died will become alive and will have bodies that are changed \f + \ft Or:that \add God\add* has changed \f*, bodies that will never decay.
\v 53 And the \add bodies of us who are alive at that time\add* will \add also\add* be changed \f + \ft Or:And \add God\add* will \add also\add* change the \add bodies of us who are alive at that time\add* \f*. These bodies of ours that die and decay must be transformed into \add new bodies that\add* will never die; \add it will be like someone\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* getting rid of \add his old clothes\add* and putting on \add new ones\add*.

<usfm>
\v 52 He will change us in an instant, as fast as one can blink his eye, when God's angels blow the final trumpet sound. For they will blow that  trumpet and then God will raise the dead so as to never die again.
\v 53 For we, even if we all die, will live forever, never to die again. Yes, our bodies that are destined for death, God will make new, never to die again.
</usfm>


===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 52 We will be changed in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed. 
\v 53 For this perishable must put on imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.
