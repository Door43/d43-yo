<usfm> \v 25 \add This is what you should do\add*: Eat any \add food\add* that is sold \f + \ft Or:that people sell \f* in the market. Do not ask questions \add to find out if that food has been offered\add* \f + \ft Or:\add someone offered that food\add* \f* \add to idols, just\add* because you think it would be wrong \add to eat such food\add*. \v 26 \add Remember that the Psalmist wrote\add*, "Everything on the earth belongs to \add the\add* Lord \add God because he created it!\add*" \add So, food that has been offered to idols belongs to the Lord, not to the idols, and you may eat it\add*. \v 27 If a non-believer invites you to a meal, go if you want to, and eat any food that is set \f + \ft Or:that \add he\add* sets \f* before you. Do not ask \add whether it was offered to idols, just\add* because you think that it would be wrong \add to eat such food\add*. </usfm>

===== UDB: =====

<usfm> \v 25 Here is our rule: you may buy whatever meat you want in the market without having to ask whether it was sacrificed to idols or not. \v 26 As the psalmist says, "The earth is the Lord's and everything in it." \v 27 If a non-Jewish unbeliever invites you to a meal, and you desire to go and eat whatever he serves you. You are not under any obligation to ask him about where he purchased the food. </usfm>

===== ULB: =====

<usfm> \v 25 You may eat whatever is sold in the market, without questions of conscience. \v 26 For "The earth is the Lordâ€™s, and the fulness of it." \v 27 If an unbeliever invites you to eat a meal, and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you without asking questions of conscience. </usfm>
