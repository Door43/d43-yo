<usfm>
\v 17 Concerning the matters \add about which I will instruct you now\add*, I do not praise you, because whenever you believers meet together, good \add things do not happen\add*. Instead, bad things \add happen\add*.
\v 18 First of all, people have told me that when you gather together as a group \add to worship God\add*, you divide into groups \add that are hostile to each other\add*. To some extent I believe that is true.
\v 19 It seems that you must divide into \add groups that despise each other\add* in order that it might be clear\f + \ft Or: evident \f* which people among you \add God\add* approves of!

\v 17 In these instructions, I cannot praise you for what you are doing about the Lord's supper. When you come together to eat, instead of encouraging and helping one another, you make the fellowship in the church much worse.
\v 18 The first matter of concern is that when you come together, you come with different groups and factions. From what people have told me, this seems to be the truth.
\v 19 It appears that you have different groups among yourselves, some are approved and have places of honor, and others are not.

\v 17 In the following instructions, I do not praise you, because when you come together, it is not for the better but for the worse.
\v 18 For in the first place, I hear that when you come together in the church, there are divisions among you, and in part I believe it.
\v 19 For there must also be factions among you, so that those who are approved may be recognized among you.
