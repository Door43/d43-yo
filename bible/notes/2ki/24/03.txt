\v 3 It was certainly at the commandment of Yahweh that this came on Judah, to remove them out of his sight, because of the sins of Manasseh, all that he did,
\v 4 and also because of the innocent blood that he shed, for he filled Jerusalem with innocent blood. Yahweh was not willing to pardon that.
