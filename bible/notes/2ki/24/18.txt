\v 18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign; he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Hamutal; she was the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
\v 19 He did what was evil in the sight of Yahweh—he did everything that Jehoiakim had done.
\v 20 Through Yahweh’s anger, all these events happened in Jerusalem and Judah, until he drove them out of his presence. Then Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
