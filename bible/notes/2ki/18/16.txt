\v 16 Then Hezekiah cut off the gold from the doors of the temple of Yahweh and
from the pillars that he had overlaid; he gave the gold to the king of Assyria.
\v 17 But the king of Assyria mobilized his great army, sending Tartan and Rabsaris and Rabshakeh from Lachish to king Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They traveled up the roads and arrived outside Jerusalem.
