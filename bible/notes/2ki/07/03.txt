\v 3 Now there were four men with leprosy right outside the city gate.They said one to another, "Why should we sit here until we die?
\v 4 If we say that we should go into the city, then the famine is in the city, and we will die there. But if we still sit here, we will still die. Now then, come, let us go to the army of the Arameans. If they keep us alive, we will live, and if they kill us, we will only die."
