\v 32 So this is what I, Yahweh, say about the king of Assyria:
\p "His armies will not enter this city;
\p they will not even shoot any arrows into it!
\p His soldiers will not \add march outside\add* the city gates carrying shields,
\p and they will not even build high mounds of dirt against \add the city walls\add*
\p \add to enable them to attack the city\add*.
\p
\v 33 Their king will return to his own country
\p on the same road on which he came here.
\p He will not enter this city!"
\p \add That will happen because\add* I, Yahweh, have said it!
\p
\v 34 I will defend this city and prevent it from being destroyed.
\q2 I will do this for the sake of my own reputation and because of what I promised to King David, who served me well.'~"

\v 32 Therefore Yahweh says this about the king of Assyria:
\q "He will not come into this city 
\q2 nor shoot an arrow here.
\q Neither will he come before it with shield 
\q2 or build up a siege ramp against it.
\q 
\v 33 The way by which he came 
\q2 will be the same way he will leave; 
\q2 he will not enter this city. 
\q3 This is the declaration of Yahweh."
\q 
\v 34 For I will defend this city and rescue it, 
\q2 for my own sake and for my servant Davidâ€™s sake.' "
