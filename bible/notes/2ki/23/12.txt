\v 12 Josiah also commanded his servants to tear down the altars that the previous kings of Judah had built on the roof of the palace, above the room where King Ahaz had stayed. They also tore down the altars that had been built by King Manasseh in the two courtyards outside the temple. He commanded that they be smashed to pieces and thrown down into the Kidron Valley.
\v 13 He also commanded that the altars that King Solomon had built east of Jerusalem, south of Olive Tree Hill, be desecrated. Solomon had built them for the worship of the disgusting idols—the \add statue of the goddess\add* Astarte \add worshiped by the people in\add* Sidon \add city\add*, Chemosh the god of the Moab people-group, and Molech the god of the Ammon people-group.
\v 14 They also broke into pieces the stone pillars that the Israelite people worshiped, and cut down the \add pillars that honored the goddess\add* Asherah, and they scattered the ground there with human bones \add to desecrate it\add*.

\v 13 Josiah defiled the shrines that were east of Jerusalem, south of the Mount of Corruption that Solomon
the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth, the disgusting idol of the Sidonians; for Chemosh, the disgusting idol of Moab; and for Milcom, the disgusting idol of the people of Ammon.
