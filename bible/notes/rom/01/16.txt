\v 16 I very confidently proclaim the good news about what Christ has done, because this good news is the powerful way in which God saves all people who trust in what Christ has done for them. Specifically, God first saves the Jews who believe the good news, and then he saves non-Jews.
\v 17 By means of this good news God reveals how he puts people right with himself. This is like what a prophet wrote long ago in the scriptures: "Those whom God puts right with himself will live because they trust him."

===== Translation Notes: =====

  * **For I am not ashamed**  - Paul explains why he wants to preach the gospel in Rome.
  * **I am not ashamed of the gospel**  - Alternate translation: "I am confident when I speak about the gospel, even if many people reject it." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_litotes|Litotes]])
  * **For in it**  - Paul explains why he preaches the gospel with confidence.
  * **power of God for salvation for everyone who believes**  - "Through the gospel God powerfully saves those who believe in Christ."
  * **to the Jew first and to the Greek**  - "to Jewish people" and "to Greek people."
  * **first**  - The good news was preached to Jews before the Greeks, so the primary meaning here is probably 1) first in order of time, but it could also mean 2) "most importantly."
  * **God's righteousness is revealed from faith to faith**  - "God has revealed that it is by faith from beginning to end that people become righteous." Alternate translations: "God has revealed his righteousness to those who have faith, and as a result they have more faith" or "Because God is faithful, he reveals his righteousness, and as a result people have more faith." (See: [[en:ta:vol2:translate:figs_activepassive|Active or Passive]])
