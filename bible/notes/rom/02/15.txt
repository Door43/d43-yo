\v 15 They show that they know in their own minds what God commands in his Law, for each person in his very own conscience either accuses himself of bad behavior or defends himself.
\v 16 God will punish them at the time when he will judge people according to what they have thought and done. He will judge them even for the things that they have done secretly. He will judge people by  authorizing Christ Jesus  to judge them. This is  what I tell people when I preach the good news to them.

===== Translation Notes: =====

Paul continues his imaginary argument with a Jewish person.

  * **By this they show**  - "By naturally obeying the Law they show"
  * **the actions required by the Law are written in their hearts**  - Alternate translations: "God has written on their hearts what the Law requires them to do" or "They know exactly what the Law commands them to do." (See: [[en:ta:vol1:translate:figs_idiom|Idiom]])
  * **required by the Law**  - This can be translated with an active verb: "the Law requires" or "that God demands through the Law."
  * **bears witness with them, and their thoughts either accuse or defend themselves**  - "tells them if they are disobeying or obeying God's law"
  * **on the day when God will judge**  - This finishes Paul's thought from [[:yo:bible:notes:rom:02:13|2:13]]. This could be translated as a new sentence: "This will happen when God judges."
