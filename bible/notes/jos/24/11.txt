====== Joshua 24:11-12 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Then you all crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The people of Jericho prepared to fight against you, and \add the armies of\add* the descendants of Amor, Periz, Canaan, Heth, Girgash, Hiv, and Jebus \add all prepared to do\add* the same thing, but I enabled you to defeat [IDI] them all.
\v 12 I am the one who caused them to panic as you advanced and enabled you to defeat them, as I had enabled you to do earlier to the two kings of the groups who were descendants of Amor. You did not defeat them by using your own bows and arrows and swords; \add it was I who defeated them\add*.
</usfm>


===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 Then you all crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, as did the armies of the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. I made all of you more powerful than them, and you defeated them all.
\v 12 I am the one who caused them to panic. They acted as if they were being chased by hornets. And you drove out the two kings of the Amorites as your army moved ahead and pushed them away. But it was not because of your swords or your bows and arrows, but it was because that I, Yahweh, was  fighting on your side.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 11 You went over the Jordan and came to Jericho. The leaders of Jericho fought against you, along with the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. I gave you victory over them and put them under your control.
\v 12 I sent the hornet before you, which drove them and the two kings of the Amorites out before you. It did not happen by your sword or by your bow.
