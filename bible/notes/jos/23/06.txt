\v 6 Pay careful attention so that you obey all the laws that are written in laws that Moses wrote down. Do not disobey them or change any of them.
\v 7 If you obey the Law of Moses, you will not mix our people with those people groups. Do not even mention the names of their gods, and do use the names of their gods when you make promises or take oaths. Do not worship those gods or bow down to them.
\v 8 Come close to Yahweh, as you have been doing, and do not turn away from him.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 So be very strong, so that you keep and do all that is written in the book of the Law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,
\v 7 so you may not mix with these nations that remain among you or make mention of their names of their gods, swear by them, worship them, or bow down to them.
\v 8 Instead, you must cling to Yahweh your God just as you have done to this day.
