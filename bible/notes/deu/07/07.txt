\v 7 It was not because you were more numerous than any other people-group that Yahweh preferred you; you are one of the smallest people-groups on the earth.
\v 8 Instead, it is because Yahweh loved you and because he wanted to do what he solemnly promised to your ancestors. That is the reason that he rescued you by his great power \f + \ft metonymy \f*, and freed you from being slaves \f + \ft metonymy \f* of the king of Egypt.

===== ULB: =====

<usfm>
\v 7 Yahweh did not set his love upon you or choose you because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples â€”
\v 8 but he loves you, and he wished to keep the oath that he had sworn to your fathers. This is why Yahweh has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
