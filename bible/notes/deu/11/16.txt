\v 16 Pay attention to yourselves, so that your heart is not deceived, and you turn aside and worship other gods, and bow down to them;
\v 17 so that the anger of Yahweh is not kindled against you, and so that he does not shut up the heavens, so that there will be no rain, and the land will not yield its fruit, and so that you perish quickly from off the good land that Yahweh is giving you.
