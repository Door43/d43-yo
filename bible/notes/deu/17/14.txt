\v 14 When you have come to the land that Yahweh your God gives you possess it and live in it, andthen say, ‘I will set a king over myself, like all the nations that are round about me,’
\v 15 then you must surely set as king over you one whom Yahweh your God will choose—one from among your brothers must you set as king over yourself; you may not put a foreigner, who is not your brother, over yourself.
