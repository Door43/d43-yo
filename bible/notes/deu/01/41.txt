\v 41 Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against Yahweh; we will go up and fight, and we will follow all that Yahweh our God has commanded us to do.’ Every man among you put on his weapons of war, and were ready to attack the hill country.
\v 42 Yahweh said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not attack and do not fight, for I will not be with you”—so that you not be defeated by your enemies.”
