\v 22 But all of your ancestors came to me and said, 'Before we go, we should \add first\add* send some men there to explore the land, in order that they can return and tell us which will be the best road to go there and what kind of towns are there.'
\p
\v 23 I thought that it would be good to do that, so I chose twelve men, one man from each tribe.
\v 24 They went up into the hilly area as far as Eshcol Valley, and they explored all that area.

\v 22 Every one of you came to me and said, â€œLet us send men ahead of us, so that they may search out the land for us, and bring us word about the way by that we should attack, and about the cities to which we will come.
\v 23 The thing pleased me well; I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe.
\v 24 They turned and went up into the hill country, came to the Valley of Eshcol, and scouted it.
