\v 7 Turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the places near there in the plain of the Jordan river valley, in the hill country, in the lowland, in the Negev, and by the seashore—the land of the Canaanites, and in Lebanon as far as the Great River, the Euphrates River.
\v 8 Look, I have set the land before you; go in and possess the land that Yahweh swore to your fathers—to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob—to give to them and to their descendants after them.’
