\v 11 But if anyone hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, and mortally wounds him so that he dies, and if he then flees into one of these citiesâ€”
\v 12 then the elders of his city must send and bring him back from there, and turn him over into the hand of the responsible relative, so that he may die.
\v 13 Your eye must not pity him; instead, you must eradicate the bloodguilt from Israel, that it may go well with you.
