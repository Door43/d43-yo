<usfm>
\v 6 He should do this so that the deceasedâ€™s relative responsible does not pursue him out of anger, catch him because the journey is too long, and kill him. This could happen, even though the man does not deserve to die, because he did not previously hate the deceased.
\v 7 Therefore I command you to select three cities for yourself.
