\v 13 She will take off the clothes she was wearing when she was taken captive, and she will remain in your house and mourn for her father and her mother a full month. After that you may go into her and be her husband, and she will be your wife.
\v 14 But if you take no delight in her, then you may let her go where she wishes; but you must not sell her at all for money; you must not treat her like a slave, because you have humiliated her.
