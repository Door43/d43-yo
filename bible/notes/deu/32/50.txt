<usfm>
\v 50 You will die on the mountain that you go up and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your fellow Israelite died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people.
\v 51 This will happen because you were unfaithful to me among the people of Israel at the waters of Meribah in Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you did not treat me with honor and respect among the people of Israel.
\v 52 For you will see the land before you, but you will not go there, into the land that I am giving to the people of Israel.‚Äù
