\v 16 The girl’s father must say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, and he hates her.
\v 17 See, he has accused her of shameful things and said, “I did not find in your daughter the proof of virginity”—yet this is the proof of my daughter’s virginity.’ And then they will spread the garment out before the elders of the city.
