\v 10 When I found Israel, they were like a traveler who finds grapes growing in the wilderness.
\q1 When I saw your ancestors, they were like the very first figs that appear, that grow on a young fig tree.  
\q1 But when they came to Mount Peor,
\q2 they gave themselves completely to that disgusting idol Baal,
\q2 and they became as detestable in what they did, as the idol they loved.
