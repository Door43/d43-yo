\v 3 I taught Ephraim to walk, like a father teaches his son,
\q2 holding them by their little arms,
\q1 But they did not understand that I was the one who was taking care of them.

\v 4 With kindness I guided them, with the tender cords of human kindness I led them. 
\q2  I loved them so much that I guided them and led by my own hand.
