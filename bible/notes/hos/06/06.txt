<usfm>
\v 6 I want you to have unending love for me,
\q2 I want that more than I want you to offer me sacrifices.
\q1 I want you to know me—that is much more important to me
\q2 than when you give me offerings that are burned on the altar.
\q1
\v 7 But like Adam, the first man, 
\q2 the promise they made with me and that I, Yahweh, made with them—they broke promise. 
\q2 When they broke their promise with me, they were fighting against me. 


\q1
