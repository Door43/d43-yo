\v 1 "Come, let us return to Yahweh.
\q1 He has torn our flesh to pieces like a lion tears up his prey,
\q2 he did this so he can heal our wounds.  
\q1 He has hurt us and made us fall down,
\q2 but did this so he can treat our wounds and bind them up so they will heal.
\q1
\v 2 After the second day he will restore our strength;
\q2 and on the third day he will raise us up,
\q2 so we will live close to him.
\q1
\v 3 Come to know—
\q2 do all you can so you might come to know—Yahweh.
\q1 When he goes out to do his work,
\q2 it is as certain as the dawn. 
\q1 his coming to us is as sure as the showers are to us, even like the rains that fall in the spring—they come and water the earth."
