\v 4 What can I do with you, O Ephraim?
\q2 and what can I do with you, O Judah?
\q1 Your love for me is like the morning cloud that  vanishes and it is gone, 
\q2 and your love is like the dew that dries up quickly when the warm sun shines on it.
\q1
\v 5 I send my prophets to you, 
\q2 and it was as though I had cut you into pieces when they spoke the message I gave them.   
\q1 You were devastated by what they said to you. 
\q2 And I slaughtered you with the words I spoke to youâ€” 
\q1 I spoke about my judgment that was coming to you 
\q2 and I made known to you my great anger in the message I gave the prophets, and they spoke that message to you.
\q1 My justice will come to you like the flashes of lightning, 
\q2 they quickly and brightly show you your sins and they make my judgment known to you.

\v 4 Ephraim, what will I do with you?
\q Judah, what will I do with you?

\q I have slain them with the words of my mouth,
\q and your decrees are like the light that shines out.
