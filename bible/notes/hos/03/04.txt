\v 4 The people of Israel will live for a long time and not have any king ruling over them; they will have no prince, there will be no sacrifices or sacred pillars set up for worship, no priestly garments made with great care and covered with the finest needlework, or the idols used to predict the future and gain special knowledge.
\v 5 But after a while, the people of Israel will return to Yahweh and to seek their God and they will find him and they will find the descendant of David their king who will reign again on David's throne.  They will come to Yahweh to honor him and tremble before him because of his goodness to them in the last days.
