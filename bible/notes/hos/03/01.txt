<usfm>
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go and show to your wife that you still love her, even though she has been committing adultery with another man who loves her. \add That will show that\add* I still love the people of Israel, even though they worship other gods\f + \ft Or: idols \f* and eat raisin cakes \add in feasts that honor those gods\add*."
\p
\v 2 \add My wife had become a slave\add*, but I bought her for 6 ounces\f + \ft Or: 179 grams \f* of silver and ten bushels of barley.
\v 3 Then I said to her, "You must wait for many days \add before we sleep together\add* \f + \ft euphemism \f*. During that time, you must not be a prostitute, and you must not have sex with any other man; but I will live with you."

\v 1 Then Yahweh said to me, "Go and love a women, even though she is loved by another man, and it is true that she is also unfaithful to her husband. This is like the love that Yahweh has for the people of Israel, even though they worship other gods and eat the special cakes that they made with fruits to honor their idols."
\p
\v 2 Even though she was a slave and another person owned her, I bought her on the slave market for six ounces of silver, and ten bushels of barley grain.
\v 3 Then I said to her, "You will live with me from now on and you will no longer be a prostitute who sleeps with many men. You will not belong to any other man, only to me, and I will be faithful to you and live with you for the rest of my life."

\c 3
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to me, "Go again, love a woman, loved by her husband, but who is an adulteress; even as Yahweh loves the people of Israel, though they turn to other gods and love raisin cakes."
\v 2 So I bought her for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and a homer and a half of barley.
\v 3 I said to her, "You will live with me many days. You will not be a prostitute, or belong to another man, and in the same way, I will be with you."
