===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 12 I will destroy all of  Israel's grapevines and fig trees,
\q2 about which she said, 'These were gifts by lovers gave me,' 
\q1 that was like saying the idols of Israel were the lovers who gave Israel the gifts of vines and figs." 
\q1 Yahweh says, 'I will turn those places into a forest, a thicket in which no vines can grow, 
\q2 and where wild animals devour any fruit that grows there.' 
\q1
\v 13 I will punish Israel for all the times that she burned incense to worship the Baal idols.
\q1 She decorated herself with rings and jewelry, like a prostitute would adorn herself for her lovers,
\q2 and she would go after her lovers— like Israel has gone after the Baals—those false gods that she worshiped.
\q2 'But Israel forgot me!' declares Yahweh.
\b

\q and the animals of the field will eat them.
\q
\v 13 I will punish her for the feast days of the Baals,

\q when she adorned herself with her rings and jewelry,
\q and she went after her lovers and forgot me,
\q says Yahweh.
