\v 1 At that time, you will say to your Israelite brothers, "You are my people," and you will say to your Israelite sisters, "I have been kind to you."
\q1
\v 2 Yahweh also said to me, "I want you to make a case against Israel (who is like your mother),
\q1 but this nation (who is like your mother), is no longer my wife,
\q2 and I am no longer your mother's husband.
\q1 Tell Israel that they must stop acting like a prostitute—her prostitution is when she worships other gods;
\q2 Israel must stop giving herself to others, and she must stop acting like a prostitute, displaying her nakedness before her lovers.
\q1
\v 3 If she does not stop, 
\q1I will take away even the clothes that Israel wears, making her as naked as the day she was born.
\q2 I will make her like the barren wilderness—dry and lifeless—
and Israel will be like one who dies for lack of water in the desert.

\v 1 Say you to your brothers, "My people!"
\q and to your sisters, "You were shown compassion."
\q
\v 2 Make a case against your mother, make a case,
\q2 for she is not my wife,
\q2 neither am I her husband.
\q Let her put away her prostitution from before her,
\q and her adulteries from between her breasts,
\q
\v 3 or I strip her naked
\q and show her nakedness as in the day that she was born,
\q and make her like the wilderness,
\q like a parched land,
\q and I should make her die from thirst.
