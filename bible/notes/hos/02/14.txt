\v 14 But listen! I will win her back. I will win again the affections Israel, as a man whose wife had been unfaithful to him. I will speak tenderly to Israel, as a man who speak to his faithless wife—and he wanted her back (but we do not know why). 
\q2 I will lead Israel into the desert, as a husband takes his wife away for a while, to try to win her back, 
\q2 and I will speak tender words to her.
\q1
\v 15 I will give her vineyards back to her once more,
\q2 and I will cause "Trouble Valley," (also called Achor Valley) to be for her a door of hope.
\q1 She will answer me with love and delight, as it was back in the first days of our loving relationship— 
\q2 like Israel loved me long ago when she came up from slavery—
\q1 and she was set free from Egypt, like those days long ago, when Israel first became my people.
