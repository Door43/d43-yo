<usfm>
\v 10 But \add some day\add* the people of Israel will be \add as numerous\add* as \f + \ft simile \f* the grains of sand on the seashore; no one will be able to count them. Now I am saying to them, 'You are not my people,' but then people will say to them, 'You are the children of God who is all-powerful.'
\v 11 At that time, the people of Judah and the people of Israel will unite. They will appoint one leader for all of them, and they will return from the countries to which they have been exiled\f + \ft Or: forced to go \f*. That will be a great time; Jezreel \add means\add* '\add God plants\add*', \add and it will be as though God will plant them in this country again\add*."

\v 10 The people of Israel will one day be as numerous as the grains of sand in all the seas. No one will be able to measure their size or count their number. In the place where Yahweh had said to Israel, 'You are not my people,'â€”in that very place Yahweh will say to Israel, 'You are children of the Living God.'
\v 11 On that day Yahweh will gather all the people of Judah and bring them together with all the people of Israel. They will appoint from their people one Leader for them all, and they will go out of that land in which they were held as exiles. And they will say on that day, "Great is the day of Jezreel!" (Jezreel means, 'God plants his people in his land.')
