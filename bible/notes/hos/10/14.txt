\v 14 The thunder of war will rise among your people, 
\q2 all your fortified cities will be destroyed, 
\q1 it will be as when Shalman destroyed Beth Arbel in only one day of battle, 
\q2 and mothers were killed while they held their children. 
\q1
\v 15 That is what will be done to you, O Bethel, 
\q2 because of all the evil things you have done.

\q2 the king of Israel will be cut off from his army and the enemy will kill him."
