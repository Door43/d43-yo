===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 They offer sacrifices to me,
\q2 and they eat \add some of\add* the meat of those sacrifices, \add which is what I permitted them to do\add*.
\q2 But I, Yahweh, am not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q1 I remember the evil things that they have done,
\q2 and I will punish them for the sins that they have committed:
\q1 I will force them to \add go to other countries\add*
\q2 \add and become slaves like they were\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* in Egypt.
\q1
\v 14 \add The people of\add* Israel have abandoned\f + \ft Or: forgotten \f* me, the one who created their \add nation\add*;
\q2 they have built palaces,
\q2 and \add the people of\add* Judah have built walls around many towns.
\q1 But I will send a fire
\q2 that will destroy all their cities and their fortresses."

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 13 Let us consider the sacrifices that you give to me. 
\q2 They sacrifice the meat and then they eat it;
\q1 but Yahweh is not pleased with those sacrifices.
\q2 Now he will remember their sins and he will punish their sins, 
\q1 and he will force them to return to Egyptâ€”to another land just like that exile was long ago, but they will return to another place and by another name!

\q1
\v 14 And why has this happened? 
\q2 Israel has forgotten the God who created him and has spent their wealth building huge palaces. 
\q1 And instead of worshiping Yahweh, Judah has built fortified cities for protection. 
\q2 And this is what I, Yahweh, will do: 
\q1 I will send a fire that will destroy all their palaces and all their fortified cities."

\v 13 As for the sacrifices of my offerings,
\q they sacrifice flesh and eat it,
\q but Yahweh does not accept them.
\q Now he will call to mind their iniquity,
\q and punish their sins.
\q They will return to Egypt.
\q
\v 14 Israel has forgotten his Maker,
\q and built palaces.
\q Judah has multiplied fortified cities,
