\q
\v 6 For this is even from Israel,
\q a workman made it,
\q and it is not God!
\q The calf of Samaria must be broken to pieces.
\q
\v 7 For they sow the wind,
\q and reap the whirlwind.
\q The standing grain has no heads,
\q it yields no flour.
\q If it does come to maturity,
\q strangers will devour it.
