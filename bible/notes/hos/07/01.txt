<usfm>
\v 1 When I decide to heal Israel, 
\q2 that will be the time I will show to everyone how great is the wickedness of Ephraim (the other name for Israel).
\q1 The evil deeds done in Samaria, they will also be healedâ€”
\q2 they lie and cheat in their buying and selling, 
\q1 they are like lawless men who beat up people only because they were walking in the streets. 
\q1
\v 2 But they do not take a moment to think that I, Yahweh, see and remember everything they have done. 
\q2 What they have done now surrounds them, 
\q1 accusing them as they stand before Yahweh, and I have seen all of them.

\q
\v 1 When I wanted to heal Israel,
\q the corruption of Ephraim is exposed
\q and the evil deeds of Samaria.
\q For they practice deceit.
\q A thief comes in,
\q and a marauding band attacks in the street.
\q
\v 2 They do not consider in their hearts
\q that I remember all their evil.
\q Now their deeds surround them,
\q they are before my face.
