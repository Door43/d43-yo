====== Hosea 04:6-7 ======


===== TFT: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 It is because my people do not know \add about me\add* that they will be destroyed.
\q1 And their not knowing about me is because you have refused \add to teach them about me\add*;
\q2 so I will no longer allow you to be my priests.
\q1 You have forgotten the things that I taught you,
\q2 so I will forget \add to bless\add* your children.
\q1
\v 7 As there are more and more priests,
\q2 they have sinned against me more and more.
\q1 So I will no longer allow them to be honored;
\q2 instead, I will cause them to be disgraced.
\q1

===== UDB: =====

<usfm>
\v 6 I will destroy my people because they have so little knowledge.
\q1 And why do you know so little? Because you have rejected what can be known,
\q2 and so I reject you from being priests to me. 
\q1 Look what you have forgotten: You have forgotten the law your God gave to you,
\q2 and because you forgot me, I will forget your children.
\q1
\v 7 The people of Israel are growing greater in number, 
\q2 and the more people they have, the more they do what I have forbiddenâ€”they sinned against me.
\q2 
\q1 Their shining honor I will change into an ugly shame that you could see on their faces. 


\q1

\q
\v 6 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge.
\q Because you have rejected knowledge,
\q I will also reject you as a priest to me.
\q Because you have forgotten the law of your God,
\q I also will forget your children.
\q
\v 7 The more they multiplied,
\q the more they sinned against me.
\q I will exchange their glory for shame.
