\v 30  Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” He stretched out with his strength, and the building fell on the rulers  and on all the people who were in it. So the dead that he killed when he died, were more than those he killed during his life.
\v 31 Then his brothers and all the house of his father came down, and they took him, and they brought him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, in the burial place of Manoah, his father. Samson judged Israel for twenty years.
