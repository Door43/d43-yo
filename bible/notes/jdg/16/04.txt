\v 4 After this Samson came to love a woman who lived in the valley of Sorek. Her name was Delilah.
\v 5 The rulers of the Philistines came up to her, and said to her, “Trick Samson to see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him, so we may overpower him, in order to humble him. Do this, and each one of us will give you 1,100 pieces of silver.”
