\v 16 So Samson's wife came to him, crying, and said to him, "You do not really love me. You hate me! You have told a riddle to my friends, but you have not told me the meaning of the riddle!"
\p He replied, "I have not told the meaning of the riddle even to my mother and father, so why should I tell it to you?"
\v 17 She continued to cry every time she was with him, all during the rest of the celebration. Finally, on the seventh day, because she continued to nag him, he told her the meaning of the riddle. Then she told it to the young men.

\v 16 Samson’s wife started crying in front of him, “All you do is hate me! You do not love me. You have told a riddle to some of my people, but you have not told me the answer.” Samson said to her, “Look here, if I have not told my father or my mother, should I tell you?”
\v 17 She cried during all seven days their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her the answer because she pressured him very much. She told the answer to the relatives of her people.
