Until then, you must not drink any wine or any alcoholic drink, and you must not eat any food that the law says you are not to eat; it would be unacceptable to God for you to eat it.

\v 6 Then the woman came and told her husband, “A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like that of an angel of God, he caused me to be very afraid. I did not ask him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name.
\v 7 He said to me, “Look! You will become pregnant, and you will give birth to a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and do not eat any food that the law declares to be unclean, because for the child will be a Nazirite to God from the time he was in your womb until the day of his death.”
