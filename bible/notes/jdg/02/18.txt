\v 19 But after that leader died, the people went back to behaving in more evil ways than their ancestors had behaved. They worshiped other gods and bowed down to them and did all \f + \ft litotes \f* the things that they thought those gods wanted them to do.

\v 18 When Yahweh raised up judges for them, Yahweh helped the judge and rescued them from the power of their enemies all the days the judge lived. For Yahweh had pity on them as they groaned because of those who oppressed them and afflicted them.
\v 19 But when the judge died, turn would turn away and do things that were even more corrupt than their fathers had done. They would go after other gods to serve them and worship them. They refused to give up any of their  evil practices or their stubborn ways.
