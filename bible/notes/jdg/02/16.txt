\v 16 Then Yahweh raised up judges, who saved them from the power of those who were stealing their possessions. 
\v 17 Yet they would not listen to their judges. They were unfaithful to Yahweh and gave themselves like prostitutes to other gods and worshiped them. They soon turned aside from the way their fathers had livedâ€”who had obeyed the commandments of Yahweh. But they did not do so.
