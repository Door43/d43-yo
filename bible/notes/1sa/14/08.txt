\v 9 If they then say to us, 'You two stay there until we come down to you,' we will stay there and not go up to them.
\v 10 But if they say to us, 'Come up here \add and fight against\add* us,' that will show us that Yahweh will enable us to defeat them. Then we will go up and fight them."

\v 8 Then Jonathan said, "We will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.
\v 9 If they say to us, 'Wait there until we come over to you'â€”then we will stay in our place and will not cross over to them.
\v 10 But if they reply, 'Come over to us,' then we will cross over; because Yahweh has given them into our hand. This will be the sign to us."
