\v 25 Let not my lord regard this worthless fellow, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal is his name,
and folly is with him. But I your servant did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.
\v 26 Now then, my lord, as Yahweh lives, and as your soul lives, since Yahweh has restrained you from
bloodguilt, and from avenging yourself with your own hand, let your enemies, and those who seek to do evil to my lord, be like Nabal.
