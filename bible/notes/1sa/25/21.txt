\v 21 Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I guarded all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him, and he has returned me evil for good.
\v 22 May God do so to the enemies of David and more also, if by the morning I leave so much as
one male of all who belong to him."
