\v 4 Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, "Do not let the king sin against his servant David. For he has not sinned against you, and his deeds have brought you good.
\v 5 For he took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine strong man, and Yahweh brought about a great victory for all Israel. You saw it and rejoiced. Why then do you sin against innocent blood and kill David without cause?"
