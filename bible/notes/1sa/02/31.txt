\v 32  You will see distress in the place where I live. Although good will be given to Israel, there will not be an old man in your house forever.
\v 33  The only one of your descendants I do will not cut off from my altar, his life will be spared so he may  weep his eyes out to grieve his heart. And all the rest of your descendants will die in the prime of life.
