\v 8 David said to Ahimelech, "Now is there not here on hand spear or sword? For I brought neither my sword
nor my weapons with me, because the kingâ€™s business was urgent."
\v 9 The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, it is here
wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want to take that, take it, for there is none but that here." David said,
"There is no sword like that; give it to me."
