\v 28 Eliab his oldest brother heard when he spoke to the men. Eliabâ€™s anger was kindled against David, and he said, "Why did you come down here? With whom have you left those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your pride, and the mischief in your heart; for you have come down here so that you might see the battle."
\v 29 David said, "What have I done now? Was it not just a question?"
