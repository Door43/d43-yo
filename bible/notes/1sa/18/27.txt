\v 27  Before those days had
expired, David went with his men and killed two hundred Philistines. David brought their foreskins,
and they gave them in full number to the king, so that he might be the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal his daughter as his
wife.
\v 28 And Saul saw and knew that Yahweh was with David. Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved him.
\v 29 Saul was even more afraid of David. Saul was continually David’s enemy.
